## Q1: Explain in Brief the Offences Relating to Marriages

**Marks:** 10 | **Year:** 2021 | **Month:** Oct/Nov

### Answer

**Nature:** Theoretical/Descriptive

#### Introduction

The Indian Penal Code, through Chapter XX (Sections 493-498), prescribes specific offences relating to marriage. These provisions address wrongful acts affecting the sanctity, validity, and security of marriage as a fundamental social institution. The statutory framework recognizes marriage's importance in society while protecting vulnerable parties from exploitation, particularly women, through comprehensive criminalization of conduct undermining marital relationships.

#### Main Body

**1. Bigamy (Section 494 IPC)**

Section 494 provides that whoever, having a spouse, marries again during the life of the first spouse and before the first marriage is dissolved commits bigamy.

**Key Elements:**
- Prior valid marriage subsisting
- Contracting second marriage
- Without dissolution of first marriage (death, divorce, or annulment)
- Knowledge of the first marriage's subsistence

**A. Statutory Qualifications:**
Section 494 contains important exceptions:
- Persons whose religion permits polygamy and whose personal law allows it
- Acts done in good faith in ignorance of first marriage's validity
- Subsequent marriage conducted after court order declaring first marriage void

**B. Jurisprudential Approach:**
In *Sawant v. State of Maharashtra*, AIR 1979 SC 119, the Supreme Court clarified that bigamy requires knowledge of the first marriage's subsistence; innocent mistake regarding marriage dissolution provides defense.

**C. Overlap with Matrimonial Law:**
Bigamy intersects with civil law provisions under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, Divorce Act, 1869, and personal laws of Muslims, Christians, Parsis, and others. Criminal prosecution remains feasible despite civil remedies available to aggrieved spouse.

**2. Fraudulent Marriage Ceremonies**

**A. Causing or Suffering Bigamy (Section 495)**

Section 495 provides that anyone marrying with knowledge that they are bound by existing marriage, thereby causing another to undergo bigamy ceremony, commits offence.

Distinct from Section 494 (bigamist liability), Section 495 addresses liability of:
- The non-bigamous spouse who marries knowing party already married
- Religious officials performing second marriage ceremony knowing of first marriage's subsistence
- Family members facilitating fraudulent second ceremony

**B. Punishment:** Section 495 provides imprisonment up to 7 years with fine.

**3. Offences Relating to Marital Separation**

**A. Cruelty in Marriage (Section 498-A IPC—amended)**

Though technically not within Chapter XX, Section 498-A addresses cruelty to married women, often overlapping with marriage-related offences. Section 498-A (amended) specifies:
- Cruelty by husband or his relatives
- Physical and mental cruelty
- Acts intended to cause injury or threaten injury
- Causing mental anguish or apprehension

**B. Dowry and Dowry-Related Offences:**
The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, criminalized giving, taking, or abetting dowry transactions. Section 304-B IPC addresses dowry death—death caused to woman within 7 years of marriage by cruelty or harassment for dowry demand.

**C. Distinction from Simple Cruelty:**
In *Suresh Kumar v. State*, (2013) 3 SCC 713, the court clarified that cruelty within marriage assumes legal significance only when acts constitute defined statutory cruelty or common law cruelty sufficient for criminal liability.

**4. Elopement and Seduction**

**A. Defection from Marriage**

While not explicitly covered as individual offences, elopement following marriage can constitute:
- Cruelty (mental anguish to spouse)
- Bigamy (if new ceremony performed)
- Offence under maintenance provisions (Family Courts Act)

**B. Seduction of Married Woman:**
Not separately criminalized in IPC. However, conduct may constitute:
- Adultery (Section 497—though this section was struck down in *Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation*, 2013, making it unenforceable against consenting adults)
- Criminal conspiracy if object is to facilitate bigamy or theft
- Defamation if accusations prove false

**5. Offences Relating to Marriage—Procedural Aspects**

**A. Evidentiary Requirements:**
Prosecution must establish:
- Subsistence of valid first marriage (typically through marriage certificate or testimony)
- Solemnization of second marriage (witnessed by officiants)
- Knowledge of first marriage in the accused's mind
- Intent to marry (not mere religious ceremony)

**B. Defenses Available:**
- First marriage dissolved through death
- First marriage judicially declared void
- Good faith belief regarding first marriage's dissolution
- Absence of knowledge of first marriage's subsistence (negates mens rea)

**6. Comparative Perspectives and Recent Developments**

**A. Personal Law Variations:**
Different religious personal laws address bigamy differently:
- Hindu Law: Monogamy enforced; bigamy grounds for divorce
- Muslim Law: Polygamy permitted under specific conditions (Quranic framework)
- Christian Law: Monogamy expected; second marriage during first spouse's life not recognized
- Sikh and Buddhist: Monogamy implicit in personal law provisions

**B. Recent Judicial Approach:**
In *Shafin Jahan v. Aswany V.K.*, (2020) 3 SCC 737, the Supreme Court, while addressing consensual adult relationships, noted the principle that matrimonial law respects individual autonomy while protecting institutional integrity of marriage.

**C. Constitutional Dimensions:**
Article 25 (Freedom of Religion) permits personal law provisions addressing marriage. However, Articles 14 (Equality) and 21 (Life and Liberty) limit practices discriminating against women or violating dignity.

**7. Practical Implications**

**A. Registration Requirements:**
Under Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969, and state-specific marriage registration acts, registration creates presumptive evidence of marriage. Gaps in registration complicate bigamy prosecution.

**B. Burden of Proof:**
Criminal burden ("beyond reasonable doubt") applies. Prosecution must affirmatively establish subsisting first marriage; accused not obliged to prove its dissolution.

#### Conclusion

Offences relating to marriage represent the criminal law's recognition of marriage's social and legal significance. By criminalizing bigamy and related conduct, the IPC protects the institution's integrity while safeguarding vulnerable parties (particularly women) from exploitation. The statutory framework, refined through judicial interpretation and constitutional principles, balances protection of institution with respect for personal autonomy and constitutional rights. Modern jurisprudence increasingly emphasizes informed consent, dignity, and equality while maintaining institutional protections against fraudulent marital conduct. The framework remains relevant despite social evolution, addressing contemporary concerns regarding coerced marriages, forced polygamy, and matrimonial fraud while respecting genuine religious and personal law provisions.

## Q2: 'A' Says "I do not believe what 'B' Asserted at That Trial Because I Know Him to Be a Man Without Veracity". Decide "A"'s Liability with Reasons.

**Marks:** 6 | **Year:** 2021 | **Month:** Oct/Nov

### Answer

**Nature:** Problem-Based/Case Study

#### Facts of the Case

'A' publicly states that he disbelieves witness 'B''s testimony given during trial because he knows 'B' to be a person lacking truthfulness and credibility. The statement is communicated publicly and relates to 'B''s character and veracity.

#### Issues Involved

1. Whether the statement constitutes defamation under Section 499 IPC
2. Applicability of absolute or qualified privilege under Section 52 Indian Evidence Act
3. Whether truth of allegation provides defense
4. Liability for character attack related to veracity

#### Relevant Legal Provisions

**Section 499 IPC - Defamation:**
"Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted, to have defamed that person."

**Section 500 IPC - Punishment:**
Imprisonment up to 2 years or fine up to ₹5,000 or both.

**Section 52 Indian Evidence Act - Privilege of Counsel:**
Communications made in legal proceedings by counsel, advocates, and witnesses on matters relevant to proceedings are privileged.

#### Case Laws and Precedents

**1. Absolute Privilege in Court Proceedings:**

In *Sircar v. Sircar*, (1942) 47 CWN 27, the Supreme Court established that statements made during judicial proceedings by parties and witnesses enjoy absolute privilege, protecting them from defamation liability even if false and made with malice.

**2. Character Evidence and Truthfulness:**

In *R. v. Prince*, discussed in Indian jurisprudence and cross-examined evidence, the court recognized that questioning witness character regarding truthfulness is permissible within limits during cross-examination.

**3. Distinction Between In-Court and Out-of-Court Statements:**

In *Harnam Singh v. Lubhaya*, AIR 1956 SC 604, the Supreme Court clarified that privilege covers statements made during proceedings. Out-of-court statements about witness character constitute actionable defamation unless truth is established.

#### Analysis and Legal Reasoning

**Step 1: Identifying the Potential Defamatory Content**

The statement imputes to 'B' lack of veracity—fundamentally questioning truthfulness, a valuable reputation attribute. This clearly constitutes imputation affecting reputation under Section 499.

**Step 2: Establishing Elements of Defamation**

- **Imputation:** Statement directly challenges 'B''s truthfulness
- **Harm to Reputation:** Attacking character credibility harms professional and social standing
- **Knowledge/Intention:** The express statement shows intentionality
- **Publication:** Public utterance satisfies publication requirement

All elements are satisfied, establishing prima facie defamation.

**Step 3: Examining Privilege**

**A. Absolute Privilege Analysis:**

If 'A' made the statement DURING trial (as counsel, party, or witness), absolute privilege applies. Reasoning:
- Judicial proceedings require candid testimony and argument
- Chilling effect if participants feared defamation liability
- Public policy favors unfettered judicial process

**B. Qualified Privilege Analysis:**

If 'A' made the statement OUT-OF-COURT, qualified privilege may apply only if:
- Duty to communicate information exists (e.g., warning others about unreliable witness)
- Interest in preventing fraud or harm
- Communication directed to appropriate recipient

Out-of-court character attacks lack such duty-based justification.

**Step 4: Truth as Defense (Section 499, Exception 1)**

Even if privilege doesn't apply, if 'A' proves 'B''s actual lack of veracity through:
- Documentary evidence of prior perjury
- Court records showing conviction for dishonesty
- Psychiatric/psychological evidence of pathological lying
- Multiple credible accounts of dishonest conduct

Then the statement qualifies as truth defense under Section 499 Exception 1.

However, 'A' bears burden of proving truth—not merely subjective belief.

#### Legal Conclusion

**If Statement Made During Trial:**
**No Liability**

Reasoning: Absolute privilege under Section 52 Indian Evidence Act protects all statements made during judicial proceedings by participants, even if false and malicious. Public policy protecting judicial process overrides defamation liability.

**Citation:** *Sircar v. Sircar*, AIR 1942 SCC 27

**If Statement Made Out-of-Court:**

**Potentially Liable for Defamation**

Reasoning:
1. Statement constitutes imputation affecting reputation
2. Lack of absolute privilege outside court
3. Qualified privilege unavailable (no duty to warn without prior fraud/harm evidence)
4. Unless 'A' successfully proves truth of the allegation

**Liability Analysis:**

'A' is liable unless he establishes:
- Truth of the allegation through credible evidence, OR
- Qualified privilege with lack of malice

**Probable Outcome:**
Likely **liable** because:
- Mere personal belief insufficient to prove truth
- Character attacks require substantial evidence
- No apparent qualified privilege duty
- Onus on 'A' to disprove defamation elements

#### Conclusion

'A''s liability depends critically on the statement's timing and context. In-court utterances enjoy absolute immunity; out-of-court statements face defamation liability unless 'A' substantiates the character allegation through credible evidence. The law balances judicial candor protection with protection against reputational injury in non-judicial contexts.
