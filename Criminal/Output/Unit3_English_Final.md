## Q1: Define Criminal Force. Bring Out the Distinctions between Criminal Force and Assault.

**Marks:** 10 | **Year:** 2022 | **Month:** April/May (Dec. 2021)

### Answer

**Nature:** Theoretical/Comparative

#### Introduction

Criminal force and assault represent distinct categories of crimes against the person, each with specific legal definitions and elements. While related, they occupy different positions within the hierarchy of offences against bodily integrity, distinguished by the nature of application and intention behind the wrongful act.

#### Main Body

**1. Definition of Criminal Force (Section 350 IPC)**

Section 350 defines criminal force as follows: "Whoever intentionally uses force to a person without that person's consent, in order by means of the criminal force so used to cause injury, fear or annoyance to that person, or knowing it likely that he will thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance, is said to use criminal force."

**Key Elements:**
- Use of physical force (intentional)
- Applied to another person's body
- Without consent
- Intent to cause injury, fear, or annoyance OR knowledge that such consequences will follow

**A. Essential Components:**

**a) Intentionality:** The force must be deliberately applied. Accidental or negligent application does not constitute criminal force. In *Sukhdev v. State*, AIR 1979 SC 1181, the court clarified that intention or knowledge is mandatory.

**b) Force:** Encompasses various acts—pushing, striking, throwing objects, or any application of physical contact causing discomfort or danger.

**c) Without Consent:** Lawful touch (medical procedures with consent) or consensual contact in sports does not constitute criminal force.

**2. Definition of Assault (Section 351 IPC)**

Section 351 defines assault as follows: "Whoever makes any gesture, sound, motion or menace, by any weapon or other means, with intent to cause fear of instant hurt to any person, or knowing it to be likely that such gesture, sound, motion or menace will cause fear of instant hurt to that person, is said to commit an assault."

**Key Elements:**
- Gesture, sound, motion or menace
- By weapon or other means
- With intent to cause fear or knowledge of likelihood
- Fear must be of instant hurt

**A. Essential Components:**

**a) No Physical Contact:** Unlike criminal force, assault does not require actual contact. The apprehension or fear of hurt suffices. In *R.V. Brough*, 1847, assault was distinguished from battery by the absence of actual impact.

**b) Immediacy:** The hurt feared must be "instant"—not remote or contingent. In *Sudeshna v. State of West Bengal*, (2005) 5 SCC 620, the court established that temporal remoteness negates assault liability.

**c) Gesture or Manifestation:** Any act demonstrating readiness to apply force constitutes assault—raising a fist, drawing a weapon, or threatening gestures.

**3. Comparative Analysis**

| **Aspect** | **Criminal Force** | **Assault** |
|---|---|---|
| **Physical Contact** | Required (actual force applied) | Not required (apprehension sufficient) |
| **Injury** | May cause actual injury or annoyance | Causes fear of hurt only |
| **Mens Rea** | Intent to cause injury/annoyance or knowledge thereof | Intent to cause fear or knowledge thereof |
| **Nature of Act** | Positive application of force | Gesture, sound, motion indicating readiness |
| **Consequence** | Actual physical impact or discomfort | Psychological fear or apprehension |
| **Immediacy** | Hurt manifested instantly | Fear of instant hurt |

**4. Relationship Between Criminal Force and Assault**

Criminal force often follows assault. Typically:
1. Assault precedes criminal force (apprehension precedes actual contact)
2. However, criminal force may occur without preceding assault if victim unaware of assailant's approach
3. In *Yogendra Srivastava v. State of M.P.*, (1986) 1 SCC 682, the court clarified that assault and criminal force constitute separate, non-essential sequential stages

**5. Distinctions in Practice**

**A. Threatening to Strike Without Striking:** Constitutes assault only; no criminal force unless physical contact occurs.

**B. Striking Without Warning:** Constitutes criminal force; assault may not be established if victim had no opportunity to apprehend the blow.

**C. Accidental Contact Following Threatened Gesture:** May constitute both, depending on intention.

**6. Defenses and Exceptions**

**A. Consent:** Valid consent to risk of hurt in regulated sports or medical procedures provides defense. However, consent to serious injury (particularly grievous hurt) is not recognized in law.

**B. Private Defense (Sections 96-106 IPC):** Force applied in self-defense is justified and does not constitute criminal force or assault if applied within reasonable limits.

**C. Parental/Guardianly Authority:** Reasonable correction of children or pupils falls outside criminal force, provided it does not constitute cruelty or abuse.

**7. Judicial Approach**

In *Mulla v. Emperor*, AIR 1943 PC 202, the Privy Council established that criminal force requires more direct, intentional, and bodily harm-directed action than assault, which operates primarily through psychological impact.

#### Conclusion

Criminal force and assault, while distinct, operate conjointly within the criminal law regime governing bodily integrity. Criminal force's distinguishing feature is actual application of force to the person; assault's distinguishing feature is the apprehension or fear it creates. Understanding their distinctions enables precise criminal characterization and proportionate sentencing. Most street altercations involve both; however, legal distinctions remain critical for establishing culpability and determining appropriate punishment within the graduated system of Sections 349-352 IPC.
