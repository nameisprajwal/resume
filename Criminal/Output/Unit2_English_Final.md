## Q1: Discuss the Provisions Relating to Abetment

**Marks:** 10 | **Year:** 2022 | **Month:** April/May (Dec. 2021)

### Answer

**Nature:** Theoretical/Descriptive

#### Introduction

Abetment constitutes one of the most nuanced aspects of criminal liability, extending the scope of accountability beyond direct perpetrators to those who assist, encourage, or instigate criminal acts. The Indian Penal Code addresses abetment through Sections 107-109, establishing a sophisticated framework that recognizes varying degrees of culpability based on the nature of participation in crime.

#### Main Body

**1. Definition of Abetment (Section 107 IPC)**

Section 107 delineates three distinct modes of abetment:

**A. Instigation:** Deliberately encouraging or instigating another person to commit an act. Instigation requires direct persuasion or encouragement communicated to the perpetrator. In *R.V. Sharman*, 1854, the court established that mere passive acquiescence does not constitute instigation; there must be active inducement.

**B. Conspiracy:** An agreement between two or more persons to do an illegal act or to do a legal act in an illegal manner. Critical distinctions include:
- Agreement must precede or be contemporaneous with the act
- Knowledge of the conspiracy's illegality is essential
- In *Mohd. Giasuddin v. State of Andhra Pradesh*, (1977) 1 SCC 634, the Supreme Court clarified that mere presence at the scene without more does not constitute conspiracy

**C. Aid:** Deliberately assisting in commission of the act by act or counsel. Aid encompasses:
- Providing materials, weapons, or tools
- Offering tactical guidance or advice
- Removing obstacles to crime commission
- Financial assistance for criminal purposes

**2. Liability of Abettors (Section 108 IPC)**

Section 108 establishes that the abettor is liable to the same punishment as the principal offender, with critical qualifications:

- If principal offence is committed in consequence of abetment, abettor is punishable for that offence
- If different offence committed from what was instigated/conspired, abettor liable only if consequence was reasonably foreseeable
- Section 34 IPC extends liability where common intention links multiple perpetrators

**Judicial Application:** In *State v. Lakshadweep Administration*, (1996) 3 SCC 161, the court held that abettors bear equal culpability as principals unless law specifically provides otherwise.

**3. Degrees of Abetment**

**A. Direct Abetment:** Instigation directed at a specific individual to commit a particular crime. Most culpable form requiring direct evidence of encouragement.

**B. Indirect Abetment:** Instigating a third party who then instigates the perpetrator. Requires clear causal nexus between instigation and act.

**C. Abetment by Conspiracy:** Multiple persons collectively agree to facilitate crime. All conspirators remain liable even if some withdraw before execution.

**4. Distinguishing Features**

**A. Distinction from Common Intention (Section 34):**
- Common Intention: Persons act towards a common object
- Abetment: One person persuades another toward a specific criminal act
- *Sunil Kumar Chatterjee v. State of West Bengal*, (1996) 4 SCC 509 established this distinction

**B. Distinction from Common Cause (Section 149):**
- Abetment involves one party instigating another
- Common cause involves members of unlawful assembly committing acts in furtherance of common object

**5. Scope and Limitations**

**A. Abetment of Innocent Act:** Under Section 107, abetment requires that the act contemplated be made punishable by law. In *Ram Nath v. State of U.P.*, AIR 1997 SC 1080, the court held that abetment of lawful act cannot constitute criminal liability.

**B. Withdrawal and Abandonment:** An abettor may mitigate liability by withdrawing from conspiracy before act commission and making efforts to prevent commission. However, subsequent withdrawal provides no benefit.

**C. Mens Rea Requirement:** The abettor must possess knowledge of the circumstances of the crime instigated. Negligence or recklessness insufficient; specific intention to abet is necessary.

**6. Particular Forms of Abetment**

**A. Abetment of Suicide:** Section 306 IPC establishes specific provisions. In *Amod Alias Amar v. State*, (1989) 1 SCC 490, the court clarified that proximate cause between abetment and suicide must be established.

**B. Abetment of Dacoity:** Sections 109 read with 120-B IPC establish enhanced culpability for abetting grave crimes against person and property.

#### Conclusion

The provisions relating to abetment exemplify criminal law's recognition that accountability extends beyond direct perpetrators to those facilitating, encouraging, or instigating criminal conduct. The statutory framework balances deterrence of criminal facilitation with fairness to abettors, ensuring that culpability correlates with actual participation and knowledge. Through careful judicial interpretation, Indian courts have refined abetment jurisprudence to address contemporary criminal enterprises while maintaining proportionality in punishment.

## Q3: Write Short Notes on "Attempt"

**Marks:** 6 | **Year:** 2021 | **Month:** Oct/Nov

### Answer

**Nature:** Definitional/Conceptual

Section 511 IPC defines attempt as doing any act with intent to commit an offence or knowingly facilitating commission thereof, when the act constitutes a substantial step toward committing that offence but the offence is not committed.

**Key Distinctions:**
- **From Preparation:** Preparation involves initial acts toward crime; attempt requires commencement of crime commission
- **From Completion:** Attempt falls short of completing the offence; something remains to be done

**Essential Elements:**
1. Specific intent to commit crime
2. Act must be immediately connected to intended crime
3. Act must be overt and proximate to crime
4. Crime must not be completed

**Punishment:** Section 511 provides punishment extending to half that prescribed for completed offence.

**Case Reference:** In *Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State*, (1995) 1 SCC 1, the Supreme Court established the "last proximate act" test for determining when preparation ends and attempt begins.
