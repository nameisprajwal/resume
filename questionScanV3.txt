**PROMPT START**

You are an expert **document-analysis and question-extraction system**.

You will be given **10 uploaded PDF files**, each containing **question papers for a specific academic year**.

### Your tasks:

### 1. **Identify Structure**

Each PDF contains:

* **Year / Month** of the exam
* **Five units** (Unit-1 to Unit-5)
* Each unit contains **multiple questions** (approx. 10 per unit, but may vary).
* Every question is printed **in two languages** → **extract only the English version**.

### 2. **Extract Questions**

For each PDF:

* Read all the units in sequence (Unit-1 to Unit-5).
* Extract **all English questions** under each unit.
* Detect marks (e.g., 10 marks / 5 marks) using the nearest heading or question group.
* Detect the **exam year/month** from PDF headers.

### 3. **Handle Duplicates**

If the same question appears in multiple PDFs:

* **Include it every time**
* With its respective **year/month** and **marks**.

### 4. **Unclear or Missing Data**

* If **marks** or **year** cannot be clearly identified, infer only from the **nearest valid heading**.
* If still not found, label as:

  * **Year: Unknown**
  * **Marks: Unknown**
* Never guess.

### 5. **Output Format**

Produce a **well-structured Markdown output**, following the exact format below:

```markdown
