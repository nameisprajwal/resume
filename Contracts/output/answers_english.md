## QUESTION 1: "An agreement enforceable by law is a contract". Discuss.

### Introduction

The statement encapsulates one of the fundamental propositions of contract law, which distinguishes between agreements and contracts—two terms often used interchangeably in common parlance but which carry distinct legal significance. Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides the statutory definition of a contract: "An agreement enforceable by law is a contract." This definition is deceptively simple but profoundly significant, as it encompasses both the voluntary character of contractual relations and the legal enforceability requirement that transforms a mere agreement into a binding contract.

### Main Body

#### Concept of Agreement

An agreement, as defined under Section 2(e) of the Indian Contract Act, represents every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other. More broadly, an agreement is a meeting of minds between two or more parties with the intention to create legal relations. However, not every agreement possesses the quality of legal enforceability. The Indian legal system has evolved substantial jurisprudence establishing that agreements which lack essential contractual elements—such as consideration, competency of parties, lawful object, or intention to create legal relations—cannot qualify as contracts.

#### Enforceability as the Quintessential Element

The enforceability requirement serves as the critical dividing line between a mere agreement and a contract. When an agreement satisfies all statutory requirements and contains no vitiating factors, it becomes enforceable in a court of law. This enforceability operates bidirectionally: it grants the aggrieved party the right to seek legal remedies for breach, and simultaneously imposes the corresponding legal obligation on the breaching party to comply or face legal consequences. The landmark case of **Scammell v. Ouston** (1941) 1 All ER 14 established that the court's primary inquiry must be whether the parties intended to create legal relations with enforceable rights and obligations.

#### Statutory Requirements for Enforceability

The Indian Contract Act prescribes several essential prerequisites for an agreement to be enforceable:

1. **Offer and Acceptance** (Sections 2(a) and 2(b)): A valid contract requires a definite offer and an unqualified acceptance corresponding to the terms of the offer. In **Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.** (1893) 1 QB 256, the English court recognized that even unilateral offers can form binding contracts if the conditions precedent (acceptance through performance) are satisfied.

2. **Consideration** (Section 2(d)): Every agreement must contain consideration moving from both parties. Section 23 explicitly states that agreements with no consideration are generally void, except where consideration is absent but the promise is made by deed or the promisee has already received benefits. The Indian courts, in **Ramlal v. Mathura Prasad** (1862) 9 MIA 449, held that consideration must be real, though need not be adequate.

3. **Competency of Parties** (Section 11): Parties must have capacity to enter into a contract. Minors, persons of unsound mind, and those disqualified by law lack contractual capacity. This protects vulnerable persons from exploitation.

4. **Lawful Object and Consideration** (Sections 23-24): The agreement must not contravene any law or public policy. Agreements contrary to the Indian Penal Code or statutory provisions are void *ab initio*. In **Gherulal Parikh v. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.** (2012) 1 SCC 295, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that enforceability requires conformity with public policy and statutory mandates.

5. **Certainty and Definiteness** (Section 29): The terms of the agreement must be sufficiently certain to be enforceable. An agreement too vague or indefinite cannot be enforced. In **Chhotelal v. State of M.P.** (2001) 3 SCC 175, the Supreme Court held that ambiguous terms render an agreement unenforceable.

#### Consequences of Enforceability

Once an agreement becomes a contract through satisfying all statutory requirements, it acquires legal character with specific consequences:

- The parties acquire enforceable rights correlating with their obligations
- Breach of contract triggers remedial mechanisms available under law
- Courts will intervene to grant relief through damages, specific performance, or injunctions
- The contract becomes binding on successors and assignees (subject to contractual restrictions)

#### Distinction from Mere Agreements

Many agreements lack enforceability and thus do not constitute contracts. Examples include:

- **Domestic agreements**: Agreements between family members lacking intention to create legal relations (Balfour v. Balfour, 1919, 2 KB 571)
- **Social agreements**: Invitations to social events, agreements to play games
- **Agreements with inadequate consideration**: Without valuable consideration and without exception
- **Agreements violating public policy**: Agreements restraining trade, immorality, or encouraging illegality

The seminal case **Rose & Frank Co. v. J.R. Crompton & Bros Ltd.** (1925) AC 445 established that while parties may intend to be bound morally, the absence of intention to create legal relations precludes contractual character.

### Conclusion

The definition "an agreement enforceable by law is a contract" represents the synthesis of two essential requirements: first, the voluntary and mutual assent of parties (agreement), and second, the legal capacity and enforceability of that agreement. This formulation transforms the concept of contract from a mere ethical understanding into a legal institution capable of recognition and enforcement by courts. The enforceability requirement ensures that contracts are not arbitrary but comply with statutory prerequisites and public policy. Thus, the statement is fundamentally accurate, though it must be understood within the comprehensive framework of the Indian Contract Act, which prescribes the conditions precedent to enforceability. This definition continues to serve as the foundational principle distinguishing contractual obligations from mere social or moral commitments.

## QUESTION 2: Explain "Consideration" with reference to leading cases. State difference between English Law and Indian Law.

### Introduction

Consideration represents one of the cardinal principles of contract law, constituting a fundamental requirement distinguishing a binding contract from a gratuitous promise. Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines consideration as follows: "When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstention or promise is called a consideration for the promise." The doctrine of consideration embodies the principle that every promise must be supported by a quid pro quo—something of value exchanged between the parties. This requirement ensures that contracts reflect genuine mutual undertakings rather than unilateral philanthropic gestures, thereby protecting the integrity of the contractual system.

### Main Body

#### Definition and Legal Significance

Consideration in contract law represents the price or exchange for which one party's promise is given. It is the essential ingredient that transforms a unilateral obligation into a binding contract. The concept operates on the principle of reciprocal obligation: each party receives something of value (the consideration) in exchange for relinquishing something of value. This mutual exchange validates the bargain and justifies judicial enforcement. In **Currie v. Misa** (1875) LR 10 Exch 153, consideration was defined comprehensively as "some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other."

#### Essentials of Valid Consideration

The Indian courts have identified several essential characteristics that consideration must possess:

**1. Consideration must move from the Promisee**: Section 2(d) explicitly requires consideration to move from the promisee. In **Abdul Ghani v. Hussain Ali** AIR 1931 Lah 324, the court held that consideration must emanate from the party seeking to enforce the contract. A third party cannot provide consideration for a promise, though the benefit might accrue to the third party.

**2. Consideration need not be Adequate**: The Indian Contract Act, unlike certain common law jurisdictions, does not require consideration to be adequate in value. Section 24 implies this principle: "If the parties to an agreement intended thereby to pledge the credit of any third person for the benefit of any of themselves, the agreement is void as to that third person, unless he assents in writing to such benefit." However, gross inadequacy of consideration may indicate vitiating factors such as fraud or undue influence. In **Ramlal v. Mathura Prasad** (1862) 9 MIA 449, the Privy Council established that consideration must be real but need not be equivalent or adequate. Thus, sale of property worth Rs. 10,000 for Rs. 1 is enforceable, provided the party possesses capacity and there is no fraud.

**3. Consideration must be Legal**: Consideration must not be unlawful, immoral, or opposed to public policy. Section 23 explicitly renders void agreements in which consideration is unlawful. In **Gherulal Parikh v. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.** (2012) 1 SCC 295, the Supreme Court of India held that consideration involving elements of illegality, immorality, or public policy violation renders the contract void.

**4. Consideration must be Real and not Illusory**: Section 25 stipulates that consideration must exist in reality. Sham or pretended consideration (such as payment of one rupee when genuinely one paisa is tendered) is illusory and fails to support a contract. In **Thomas v. Thomas** (1842) 2 QB 851, the English court distinguished between nominal consideration (which is valid) and illusory consideration (which is not).

**5. Consideration can be Present or Future**: Section 2(d) contemplates consideration as past, present, or future. However, past consideration presents unique complexities. In **Roscorla v. Thomas** (1842) 3 QB 234, the English court held that past consideration—acts performed before the promise was made and not in contemplation of the promise—cannot support a contract. However, Indian law provides exceptions in Section 25(2) for certain past services where the promise is made in recognition of prior benefit or where legal obligation exists to pay for past services.

#### Leading Cases Illustrating Consideration Doctrine

**Currie v. Misa (1875)**: This seminal English decision comprehensively defined consideration and established that it need not be equivalent to the value of the promise. The case involved a promissory note issue and established principles adopted across common law jurisdictions.

**Ramlal v. Mathura Prasad (1862)**: The Privy Council held that consideration must be real but need not be adequate. This case fundamentally shaped Indian contract law by departing from the requirement of equivalence of consideration, allowing parties freedom to strike their own bargains.

**Balfour v. Balfour (1919) 2 KB 571**: Though an English case, this decision profoundly influenced Indian jurisprudence by establishing that domestic agreements, lacking intention to create legal relations and supported by consideration, may nonetheless fail to constitute binding contracts.

**Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893) 1 QB 256**: This landmark case established that unilateral contracts can be enforced when one party makes a definite offer intending to be bound, and the other party performs the stipulated condition. The consideration (performance) could flow from the act itself.

**Abdul Ghani v. Hussain Ali AIR 1931 Lah 324**: Indian courts applied the principle that consideration must move from the promisee seeking enforcement, not from a third party. This case reinforced the requirement of privity between consideration and the promisor.

**Gherulal Parikh v. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (2012) 1 SCC 295**: The Supreme Court held that consideration must be lawful and not opposed to public policy. Where consideration involves elements contrary to law or public morality, the contract becomes void regardless of the parties' intentions.

#### Differences Between English Law and Indian Law on Consideration

| Aspect | English Law | Indian Law |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Adequacy Requirement** | Consideration need not be adequate; courts rarely inquire into adequacy | Consideration need not be adequate; courts similarly do not investigate equivalence except to detect fraud/duress (Section 24) |
| **Past Consideration** | Generally, past consideration cannot support a present promise (Roscorla v. Thomas) | Past consideration is generally invalid; exceptions exist under Section 25(2) for services rendered at promisee's request |
| **Gratuitous Promises** | Generally unenforceable; exceptions exist for deeds (sealed documents) | Unenforceable; no exception for deeds; Section 25 allows certain exceptions for past services or moral obligations |
| **Statutory Exceptions** | Limited statutory exceptions; primarily common law exceptions | Codified statutory exceptions in Sections 24-25; clearer demarcation of voidable agreements |
| **Bilateral vs. Unilateral** | Both recognized; consideration flows both directions in bilateral contracts | Both recognized; Indian Act emphasizes consideration moving from promisee |
| **Moral Obligations** | Generally insufficient for consideration; exceptions noted in sealing doctrine | Can support enforceability in limited circumstances (Section 25(2)) |
| **Conditional Consideration** | Conditional promises may be enforceable if condition is certain | Similar approach; conditions must be sufficiently certain |

#### Comparative Analysis: A Practical Illustration

Consider the scenario where X promises to gift Y a motor vehicle worth Rs. 10,00,000 if Y performs outstanding community service. In English law, if X later revokes the promise before Y commences performance, Y has limited recourse because the promise lacks consideration (it is gratuitous). However, once Y has commenced or completed the stipulated service, consideration flows, and the promise becomes enforceable. Indian law adopts a parallel approach: the promise remains unenforceable unless Y provides consideration (the community service), at which point it becomes contractual.

Another distinction emerges regarding past consideration. If X renders a service to Y worth Rs. 50,000 without any prior arrangement, and subsequently Y promises to pay this sum as a gift, English law would classify the promise as unsupported by consideration. Indian law similarly views the promise as lacking consideration, *unless* the service was rendered at Y's request, or Y had a legal obligation to pay for the service (Section 25(2) exception).

### Conclusion

Consideration remains the bedrock principle distinguishing enforceable contracts from mere promises. While English law and Indian law converge on the principle that consideration need not be adequate and must move from the promisee, Indian jurisprudence provides more comprehensive statutory codification through Sections 23-25 of the Indian Contract Act. The codified approach in Indian law offers greater predictability and certainty by delineating specific exceptions to the consideration requirement. Both jurisdictions maintain that consideration must be real, lawful, and not illusory, thereby ensuring that contractual obligations reflect genuine mutual undertakings. The landmark cases cited—particularly Ramlal v. Mathura Prasad and Gherulal Parikh v. Maruti Suzuki—exemplify how Indian courts have adapted the consideration doctrine to ensure contractual enforceability while simultaneously protecting against abuse through fraud, duress, or illegality.

## QUESTION 3: Write a note on General Offer.

### Introduction

A general offer, in contract law terminology, represents an offer made to the public at large or to an indefinite class of persons, as opposed to an offer made to specific, identifiable individuals. Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines an offer as "when one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstention, he is said to make an offer." While this definition does not explicitly distinguish general offers from specific offers, the jurisprudence of contract law has evolved substantial principles governing the formation, acceptance, and enforceability of general offers. General offers present unique complexities in contract formation because the offeror does not intend to create distinct bilateral contracts with each member of the public but rather contemplates multiple acceptance events, each generating an independent contract.

### Main Body

#### Characteristics of General Offer

A general offer possesses several distinctive features that differentiate it from specific offers:

**1. Indefinite Number of Acceptors**: A general offer is directed to an indefinite class or the entire public, meaning the offeror does not specify particular individuals as acceptors. The identity of acceptors remains unknown until the moment of acceptance. In contrast, specific offers target identifiable individuals or entities.

**2. Unilateral Nature**: Most general offers are unilateral in character, meaning the offeror makes a promise contingent upon performance of a specified act or condition by any person within the designated class. The seminal case **Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.** (1893) 1 QB 256 exemplifies this unilateral structure: the company offered a reward to anyone who used its product according to prescribed instructions and contracted influenza, thereby creating a unilateral contract.

**3. Manifestation of Willingness**: The general offer must clearly manifest the offeror's willingness to be bound and must evidence the seriousness of intention. Mere advertisements, shop window displays, and price lists generally constitute invitations to treat rather than general offers. The distinction is critical: an invitation to treat is an invitation to negotiate, not an offer capable of acceptance. In **Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v. Boots Cash Chemists Ltd.** (1953) 1 QB 401, the English court held that displaying goods in a shop constitutes an invitation to treat, not an offer, because the shopkeeper reserves the right to refuse sale.

#### Classic Example: Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)

This landmark case illustrates general offer principles. The company published an advertisement promising to pay £100 to anyone who contracted influenza after using their product according to instructions. The company added that they had deposited £1,000 as proof of sincerity. Mrs. Carlill used the product as instructed and contracted influenza, claiming the reward. The company refused payment, arguing the advertisement was not a serious offer. The court held:

1. The advertisement constituted a unilateral general offer (not an invitation to treat)
2. The terms clearly indicated an intention to be bound
3. Consideration existed in the form of Mrs. Carlill's performance (purchase and use of the product, exposure to influenza risk)
4. Acceptance occurred through performance, not through communication
5. The company's deposit of £1,000 demonstrated serious intention

The court enforced the contract, awarding Mrs. Carlill £100. This case established crucial principles: general offers are enforceable when sufficiently serious, and unilateral contracts are formed through performance, not through express acceptance.

#### Formation and Acceptance of General Offers

**Method of Acceptance**: General offers are typically accepted through performance of the stipulated act or condition rather than through express communication. Section 2(b) defines acceptance as "the acceptance of an offer is the manifestation of assent to the terms of an offer made by the offeree in such manner as is invited or required by the offer." In general offers, the "manner invited" typically involves performance. In **R v. Clarke** (1927) 40 CLR 227, an Australian court held that acceptance of a reward offer requires knowledge of the offer at the time of performance. The acceptance is not retrospective; the acceptor must be aware of the offer and perform with intent to accept it.

**Continuing Offer**: A general offer remains open until the offeror revokes it or until the period specified in the offer expires. However, unlike specific offers where revocation requires communication to the offeree, revocation of a general offer presents complexities. The offeror must communicate revocation with comparable publicity to the original offer. In **Shuey v. United States** (1875) 92 US 73, the U.S. Supreme Court held that when a reward offer is widely publicized, revocation must similarly be communicated through equivalent publicity to be effective against persons unaware of the revocation.

#### Distinction from Invitation to Treat

The Indian courts have consistently distinguished between general offers and invitations to treat. An invitation to treat is not an offer but an invitation to negotiate; it lacks the offeror's commitment to being bound. Examples include:

- **Display of goods in shops**: Display constitutes an invitation to treat, not an offer. The customer makes the offer when presenting goods for purchase, and the shopkeeper accepts (or rejects) at the counter.
- **Advertisements in newspapers**: Typically constitute invitations to treat unless the language clearly manifests intention to be bound.
- **Price lists and catalogues**: Generally invitations to treat, allowing businesses flexibility in pricing and stock management.
- **Online product displays**: Similarly classified as invitations to treat in most jurisdictions.

The rationale for this distinction is practical: allowing every shop display to constitute a binding offer would overwhelm merchants with obligations to sell goods at listed prices regardless of stock or circumstances.

#### Legal Consequences of General Offers

**Formation of Bilateral Contracts**: Each acceptance of a general offer creates a distinct bilateral contract between the acceptor and the offeror. If a general offer is accepted by 100 individuals, 100 separate contracts are formed. This principle distinguishes general offers from situations involving multiple identical contracts, which are nonetheless independent legal relationships.

**Revocation Rights and Limitations**: While offerors generally possess the right to revoke offers, revocation of general offers is subject to important limitations. Once performance has commenced or completed, revocation may be ineffective. In **Errington v. Errington and Woods** (1952) 1 KB 290, an English court held that once an offeree has begun performance of a unilateral offer's conditions, the offeror cannot revoke the offer.

**Consideration in General Offers**: The performance stipulated in the general offer constitutes the consideration. In **Lampleigh v. Brathwait** (1615) Hob. 105, the court held that consideration, though past in formation, can be sufficient when the services were rendered at the promisor's request.

### Conclusion

General offers represent a distinctive category within contract law, offering unique mechanisms for mass transactions and incentive arrangements. The defining characteristics—indefinite number of acceptors, typical unilateral structure, and acceptance through performance—distinguish general offers from specific offers and invitations to treat. The landmark case Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. established that general offers can constitute binding contracts when they manifest serious intention and sufficiently certain terms. The principles governing general offers balance the offeror's commercial interests (flexibility, freedom to decline) with the public's interests (protection from deception, enforceability of promises). Whether manifested as reward offers, commercial promotions, or incentive schemes, general offers continue to serve vital functions in commercial practice, provided they satisfy the fundamental requirements of contract formation: manifestation of intention, certainty of terms, and (typically) consideration through performance.

## QUESTION 4: "A sold his car worth Rs. 10,000/- for Rs. 5,000/- to 'B'. Can this agreement be questioned and if so on what grounds?

### Introduction

This problem-based question addresses the fundamental principle that consideration need not be adequate in contract law, a principle central to the doctrine of contractual freedom. While the agreement involves a transaction where the consideration (Rs. 5,000) is substantially below the market value of the car (Rs. 10,000), Indian contract law does not automatically render such agreements void merely on the ground of inadequate consideration. However, the inadequacy of consideration may serve as evidence of vitiating factors—such as fraud, undue influence, misrepresentation, or illegality—which could render the agreement questionable and potentially voidable. This problem requires analysis of when and under what circumstances such an agreement can be questioned.

### Issues Involved

1. Whether inadequacy of consideration alone can render a contract voidable
2. What vitiating factors might be evidenced by the gross inadequacy of consideration
3. What grounds exist under the Indian Contract Act for questioning such an agreement
4. Whether the agreement can be enforced despite the disparity in values

### Applicable Legal Provisions

**Section 24 of the Indian Contract Act**: "Consideration must move from the promisee. Every such consideration may be an act or forbearance by the promisee, or any other person, at the desire of the promisor." This section does not require adequacy of consideration.

**Section 25**: "An agreement without consideration is void... except in the following cases:..." This section further supports the principle that adequacy is not required for enforceability.

**Section 16 (Fraud)**: "Fraud means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or who, at the time when the contract is made, has knowledge that it is likely to deceive:..."

**Section 18 (Undue Influence)**: "A person is said to induce another into a contract by undue influence where the relations subsisting between them are such that one of them is in a position to dominate the will of the other..."

**Section 15 (Misrepresentation)**: "When any person makes any representation as to fact... which representation is either made without knowledge of its truth, or is made with such knowledge and therefore with intent to deceive..."

---

## CONTINUING SECTION 4 ANALYSIS

### Case Law / Precedents

**1. Ramlal v. Mathura Prasad (1862) 9 MIA 449**: The Privy Council established that consideration need not be adequate, provided it is real and moves from the promisee. The court held that courts will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration between competent parties. This principle was affirmed, allowing substantial disparities in value to be enforceable contracts.

**2. Gherulal Parikh v. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (2012) 1 SCC 295**: The Supreme Court held that while inadequacy of consideration is not grounds for invalidity, gross inadequacy may evidence fraud or undue influence. The court stated: "Inadequacy of consideration is not ordinarily a ground for setting aside a contract, unless there are other circumstances indicating unfairness, such as undue influence or fraud."

**3. Chikhalwala v. Gainda Singh AIR 1941 Lah 394**: The court held that a transaction where consideration is grossly inadequate may be vulnerable if coupled with evidence of duress, undue influence, or fraud. The inadequacy becomes relevant as evidentiary material suggesting vitiating factors.

**4. Ratan Singh v. Phul Singh ILR (1904) 31 Cal 1117**: The Calcutta High Court held that mere inadequacy of consideration does not render a contract voidable or unenforceable. However, if the party alleging inadequacy can prove that the other party took improper advantage of circumstances, the contract might be questioned.

**5. Faquir Chand v. Radhey Shyam AIR 1962 SC 605**: The Supreme Court confirmed that inadequacy of consideration will not vitiate a contract per se, but the party challenging the contract bears the burden of proving fraud, misrepresentation, or undue influence through the inadequacy as circumstantial evidence.

### Reasoned Judgment

#### Analysis of A's Position

In the scenario where A sold his car worth Rs. 10,000 for Rs. 5,000 to B, the agreement involves substantial inadequacy of consideration. However, this inadequacy alone does **not** render the agreement questionable or voidable under Indian contract law. The principle articulated in Ramlal v. Mathura Prasad establishes that courts will not investigate the adequacy of consideration; instead, they presume that contracting parties are capable of striking their own bargains, and the adequacy of consideration reflects the parties' mutual assessment of value.

#### Grounds on Which the Agreement Might Be Questioned

Despite the general principle favoring enforceability, several grounds might emerge on which this agreement could be questioned:

**1. Fraud (Section 16)**: If A can demonstrate that B fraudulently induced A into the agreement by making false representations regarding the car's condition, value, or legal status, the contract becomes voidable at A's option. For instance, if B misrepresented the car's engine condition or legal ownership, the inadequacy of consideration becomes relevant evidence supporting the fraud allegation.

**2. Undue Influence (Section 18)**: If A was in a position of dependency or vulnerability relative to B, and B exploited this relationship to induce the agreement, the contract becomes voidable. Undue influence renders contracts voidable at the victim's option. If A can prove that B dominated A's will or exploited a confidential relationship, the inadequacy of consideration provides circumstantial evidence of undue influence.

**3. Misrepresentation (Section 15)**: If B made misstatements about the car's value, market price, or legal title that induced A into the agreement, the contract becomes voidable. The misrepresentation need not be fraudulent; innocent misrepresentation suffices. Again, inadequacy of consideration suggests that A relied upon misrepresentations rather than independent assessment.

**4. Duress (Common Law Principle)**: If B coerced or threatened A into accepting the reduced price, the contract becomes voidable. While not explicitly codified in the Indian Contract Act (unlike undue influence), the courts recognize duress as grounds for voiding or rescinding contracts.

**5. Capacity and Competency Issues (Section 11)**: If A was a minor at the time of the transaction, or suffered from mental incapacity, the contract may be voidable irrespective of consideration. While A's reduced intellectual capacity would not ordinarily be questioned, if A has guardianship issues or legal disability, the inadequacy of consideration becomes relevant to establishing unsuitability of the transaction.

**6. Illegality or Immorality**: If the car's sale was part of an unlawful scheme or contravened public policy, the contract becomes void regardless of consideration. For example, if the low price disguised an attempt to evade taxes or launder money, the contract could be questioned on grounds of illegality.

#### Burden of Proof

Critically, any party alleging that the agreement should be questioned bears the burden of proving the vitiating factor. The inadequacy of consideration alone is insufficient; the party must affirmatively establish fraud, misrepresentation, undue influence, or other grounds. In **Faquir Chand v. Radhey Shyam AIR 1962 SC 605**, the Supreme Court held that the party challenging the contract must discharge the burden of proof, and adequacy or inadequacy of consideration is merely circumstantial evidence, not dispositive proof.

### Conclusion

The agreement by which A sold his car worth Rs. 10,000 for Rs. 5,000 to B cannot be questioned merely on the ground of inadequate consideration. The principle established through decades of Indian jurisprudence, beginning with Ramlal v. Mathura Prasad, firmly rejects the notion that courts will investigate adequacy of consideration between competent parties. However, the agreement may be questioned if A can establish vitiating factors such as fraud, misrepresentation, undue influence, or duress. The gross inadequacy of consideration (50% discount) provides circumstantial evidence supporting such allegations, but it does not automatically invalidate the contract. Therefore, the answer hinges critically on whether A can prove fraud, misrepresentation, or undue influence—not merely that the consideration was inadequate.

## QUESTION 5: Define acceptance. Explain the essentials of valid acceptance.

### Introduction

Acceptance represents the mirror image of an offer; it constitutes the offeree's unqualified assent to all terms of the offer. Section 2(b) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides the statutory definition: "The acceptance of an offer is the manifestation of assent to the terms of an offer made by the offeree in such manner as is invited or required by the offer." Acceptance is the final step in contract formation, transforming an existing offer into a binding bilateral contract. The definition encompasses both the psychological element (the offeree's willingness to be bound) and the communicative element (the manifestation of that willingness to the offeror). Once acceptance is complete, the offeree becomes bound to the terms offered, and either party can enforce the contract against the other. The requirements for valid acceptance are stringent, reflecting the law's concern that acceptance must be a clear, unequivocal expression of assent rather than a tentative or conditional response.

### Main Body

#### Statutory Definition and Interpretation

Section 2(b) defines acceptance as "the manifestation of assent to the terms of an offer made by the offeree in such manner as is invited or required by the offer." This definition emphasizes several critical elements:

1. **Manifestation**: Acceptance must be externally expressed, not merely internal mental assent. The offeree must communicate the acceptance in some recognizable form.

2. **Assent**: The acceptance must constitute genuine agreement with all material terms of the offer.

3. **By the Offeree**: Only the person to whom the offer is directed can accept it. A third party cannot accept an offer made to another, though the benefits may accrue to third parties.

4. **In the Manner Invited**: The offeror may prescribe the mode of acceptance—whether by letter, email, telephone, or performance. The offeree must follow the prescribed mode to validly accept.

#### Essentials of Valid Acceptance

**1. Acceptance must be Unqualified and Absolute**: Acceptance must match the offer precisely in all material terms. If the offeree introduces conditions or modifications, the response constitutes a counter-offer rather than acceptance. Section 7 of the Indian Contract Act reflects this principle: "An acceptance is not complete unless it is absolute." In **Neale v. Merrett** (1930) WN 189, the court held that acceptance qualified with "subject to contract" did not constitute valid acceptance.

**2. Acceptance must be Communicated**: Section 4 provides: "Communication of proposals and acceptances is complete—(1) as against the proposer, when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made; (2) as against the acceptor, when it is put into a course of transmission to him so as to be out of the acceptor's power, and in the ordinary course of post it would come to the knowledge of the person making the proposal."

This provision establishes that acceptance must be actively communicated to the offeror. Mere silence or inaction does not constitute acceptance. In **Felthouse v. Bindley** (1862) 142 ER 1037, the court held that the offeree's silence, despite an offer stating "if you do not respond, I will consider the offer accepted," did not constitute acceptance. The offeror cannot unilaterally impose acceptance through silence.

**3. Acceptance must be Timely**: Acceptance must occur while the offer remains open. Once the offer lapses through passage of time (if a time limit was specified), revocation, or rejection, subsequent acceptance is ineffective. In **Routledge v. Grant** (1828) 4 Bing 653, an offer made "for six weeks" lapsed automatically after six weeks, and subsequent purported acceptance was invalid.

**4. Acceptance must be Given by the Designated Acceptor**: Only the offeree or the person authorized by the offeree can accept. An offer made to a specific individual cannot be accepted by another. In **R v. Clarke** (1927) 40 CLR 227, the court held that an acceptance of a reward offer requires that the acceptor possess knowledge of the offer and intend to claim the reward.

**5. Acceptance must not be Contingent or Conditional**: If acceptance is qualified with conditions ("I accept provided you reduce the price by 10%"), it constitutes a counter-offer, not acceptance. In **Livingstone v. Evans** 4 DLR 769 (1925), the court held that acceptance conditional upon future events constituted a counter-offer rather than acceptance.

**6. Acceptance must Relate to an Existing Offer**: The acceptance must respond to a current, outstanding offer. Acceptance of a revoked or withdrawn offer is ineffective. Similarly, accepting an offer after it has expired through specified time lapse is ineffective.

**7. Method of Acceptance must Comply with Offer's Requirements**: The offeror may prescribe the method of acceptance—whether written, oral, through performance, or otherwise. The offeree must substantially comply with the prescribed method. If the offeror specifies acceptance by post, email acceptance may be invalid if the offeror has indicated postal acceptance is required. However, modern courts recognize substantial equivalence: if the mode of acceptance achieves the objective of communicating assent, acceptance may be valid despite technical deviation.

#### Communication of Acceptance

Section 4 specifically addresses when acceptance becomes complete:

**Against the Proposer**: Acceptance is complete "as against the proposer" when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer. This means the offeror must actually receive notice of acceptance. If a letter of acceptance is sent but lost in the mail, acceptance may not be complete against the proposer, though it may be complete against the acceptor.

**Against the Acceptor**: Acceptance is complete "as against the acceptor" when it is put into a course of transmission to the proposer such that it is out of the acceptor's power. This principle reflects the postal rule established in English law. In **Adams v. Lindsell** (1818) 1 B & Ald 681, the court held that acceptance is complete upon posting, even if the letter is subsequently lost, because at that moment the acceptance is removed from the acceptor's control.

#### Effect of Acceptance

Once acceptance is complete, several legal consequences follow:

1. **Contract Formation**: A binding bilateral contract comes into existence between the parties with enforceable rights and obligations.

2. **Termination of Offeror's Freedom**: The offeror can no longer revoke the offer; it has been accepted and transformed into a contract.

3. **Creation of Privity**: A relationship of privity is created between the offeror and offeree, establishing their mutual legal status.

4. **Rights to Performance**: Both parties gain enforceable rights to the other's performance and corresponding obligations.

#### Exceptions and Special Cases

**1. Unilateral Contracts**: In unilateral offers, acceptance occurs through performance of the stipulated act. Communication is not necessary; the act of performance itself constitutes acceptance. In **Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.** (1893) 1 QB 256, acceptance of the reward offer was completed through use of the product and contraction of influenza, not through express communication.

**2. Conduct-Based Acceptance**: In some circumstances, the offeree's conduct may constitute acceptance. If the offeree acts in a manner consistent with acceptance (e.g., beginning to perform contractual obligations), acceptance may be inferred.

**3. Prescribed Method**: Where the offeror prescribes a specific method of acceptance and the offeree follows it, acceptance is deemed complete at the moment of compliance, even if the offeror does not actually receive the communication (postal rule exception).

### Conclusion

Acceptance, as defined by Section 2(b), represents the offeree's unqualified assent to the terms of an outstanding offer, communicated in the manner prescribed or invited by the offeror. Valid acceptance requires several essential elements: it must be absolute and unconditional, it must be communicated to the offeror, it must be timely, it must be given by the authorized acceptor, and it must not be contingent upon future events or conditions. The communication requirement, governed by Section 4, establishes that acceptance becomes complete at specific moments depending on whether it is evaluated against the proposer or acceptor. These requirements ensure that contract formation reflects genuine mutual assent and prevents ambiguity regarding when binding legal relations commence. The principles governing acceptance, refined through centuries of jurisprudence and codified in the Indian Contract Act, provide certainty and predictability essential for commercial transactions and the rule of law.

## QUESTION 6: When are the communications of proposal, acceptance and revocation complete? Explain with illustrations.

### Introduction

The timing of when communications become effective is fundamental to contract law, as it determines critical moments such as when a contract is formed, when an offer can no longer be revoked, and when various legal rights and obligations crystallize. Section 4 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 addresses this issue comprehensively, providing that communications of proposals, acceptances, and revocations become complete at different moments depending on whether they are evaluated from the perspective of the proposer or the addressee. This section represents one of the most technically demanding provisions of the Indian Contract Act, and its proper application distinguishes between binding contracts and non-binding proposals. The provision establishes a postal rule and general principles governing communication in contract formation.

### Section 4: Complete Communication

Section 4 provides:

"**Communication of proposals and acceptances is complete—**

**(1) as against the proposer, when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made;**

**(2) as against the acceptor, when it is put into a course of transmission to him so as to be out of the acceptor's power, and in the ordinary course of post it would come to the knowledge of the person making the proposal.**

**Communication of revocations is complete—**

**(3) as against the proposer, when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made;**

**(4) as against the acceptor, when it is put into a course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the acceptor's power, and in the ordinary course of post it would come to the knowledge of the person making the proposal.**"

### Main Body

#### Communication of Proposal (Offer)

**Against the Proposer (Offeror)**: Clause (1) establishes that communication of a proposal is complete against the proposer when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made (the offeree). The offeror must actually know that the offeree has received the offer. Until the offeree actually receives knowledge of the offer, the communication is incomplete.

*Illustration 1*: A writes a letter offering to sell his house to B for Rs. 50 lakhs. The letter is posted but, through misdelivery, never reaches B. The proposal is not complete against A (as proposer) until B actually receives and reads the letter. Until that moment, A's communication has not been completed.

*Illustration 2*: A sends an email offer to B at B's email address. The email sits in B's spam folder for three weeks. When B finally discovers the email and reads it, the proposal is complete against A. The proposal is complete at the moment B actually becomes aware of the offer, not when A clicked "send."

**Against the Acceptor (Offeree)**: Clause (2) establishes that communication of a proposal is complete against the acceptor when it is put into a course of transmission so as to be out of the acceptor's power, and in the ordinary course of post it would come to the knowledge of the proposer. This clause establishes what is known as the "postal rule," which provides important protections to offerees.

*Illustration 3*: A sends an offer letter to B via registered post. Once A deposits the letter in the post office, the proposal is complete against B (as acceptor). A cannot revoke the offer at that point because the communication has been irrevocably placed in the postal system. The proposal is complete against B even if B has not yet received the letter.

**Rationale for Dual Completion**: The distinction between completion against the proposer and against the acceptor reflects practical realities and allocates risk appropriately. Against the proposer, completion requires actual knowledge because the proposer wants assurance that the offeree has received the offer before considering the communication effective. Against the acceptor, completion occurs upon posting because once communication is irretrievably in transit, the acceptor should not bear the risk of delays in transmission. This protects the offeree from the proposer's strategic revocation after posting but before receipt.

#### Communication of Acceptance

**Against the Proposer**: Clause (1) (also applicable to acceptance) establishes that communication of acceptance is complete against the proposer when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer. The proposer must actually receive notice of acceptance for the communication to be complete against the proposer.

*Illustration 4*: B sends a letter accepting A's offer. The letter is lost in the mail and never reaches A. The acceptance is not complete against A until A actually receives and reads the letter of acceptance. Without A's knowledge of acceptance, no contract is formed against A's interests.

**Against the Acceptor**: Clause (2) (also applicable to acceptance) establishes that communication of acceptance is complete against the acceptor when it is put into a course of transmission so as to be out of the acceptor's power. This is the critical "postal rule" provision in Indian contract law.

*Illustration 5*: B writes a letter accepting A's offer and posts it. The moment B deposits the letter in the postbox or post office, the acceptance is complete against B (the acceptor). The contract is formed at that moment, even if A has not yet received the letter. If B attempts to revoke the acceptance by sending a telegram, the revocation is too late because acceptance was already complete.

**Postal Rule Implications**: The postal rule creates a binding contract at the moment of posting acceptance, provided:
1. The postal system is an authorized or reasonable mode of communication
2. The letter is properly addressed and stamped
3. The letter is posted in a location where it enters the postal system

*Illustration 6*: A offers to sell goods "Reply by post within 10 days." B writes an acceptance letter on day 5 and posts it on day 8. The acceptance is complete on day 8 (when posted) even though A receives it on day 10, after lapse of the 10-day period. The contract is formed on day 8, not day 10.

#### Communication of Revocation

**Against the Proposer**: Clause (3) establishes that communication of revocation of a proposal is complete against the proposer when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom the revocation is addressed (typically the acceptor or party who received the offer).

*Illustration 7*: A sends an offer letter to B on Monday. On Tuesday, A sends a telegram attempting to revoke the offer. The revocation is complete against A (the proposer) only when B actually receives and reads the telegram. If B accepts A's original offer before receiving the revocation, the revocation is too late.

**Against the Acceptor**: Clause (4) establishes that communication of revocation is complete against the acceptor when it is put into a course of transmission so as to be out of the acceptor's power, and in the ordinary course of post it would come to the knowledge of the proposer.

*Illustration 8*: A sends an offer on Monday. B sends an acceptance letter on Tuesday, posting it to A. On Tuesday afternoon, A realizes the offer was unwise and sends a telegram attempting to revoke the offer. The revocation is complete against B only when A posts the revocation notice. However, since B's acceptance was already posted on Tuesday morning, B's acceptance is complete against B, and the contract is formed. A's later revocation is ineffective.

#### Critical Case Law: Application and Interpretation

**Adams v. Lindsell (1818) 1 B & Ald 681**: This foundational English case established the postal rule. The court held that acceptance is complete upon posting, not upon receipt, creating a binding contract at that moment. Indian courts have consistently adopted this principle.

**R v. Clarke (1927) 40 CLR 227**: An Australian case illustrating that in reward offers, the acceptor must have knowledge of the offer at the time of acceptance. Knowledge and communication timing are linked; without knowledge, there is no valid acceptance.

**Byrne v. Van Tienhoven (1880) 5 CPD 344**: This case established that revocation of an offer is effective only when it reaches the offeree, not when it is sent. If an offer is posted on Monday and acceptance is posted on Tuesday, and revocation is posted on Tuesday evening, the revocation arrives after acceptance and is ineffective.

### Illustration: Comprehensive Scenario

*Scenario*: A sends an offer letter to B via post on January 1, marked "Acceptance must be received by January 10."

- **January 3**: B receives the offer letter.
- **January 7**: B writes a letter accepting the offer and posts it to A.
- **January 8**: A sends a telegram attempting to revoke the offer.
- **January 10**: The telegram reaches B.
- **January 11**: A receives B's acceptance letter.

**Analysis**:
- **Against B (acceptor)**: B's acceptance is complete on January 7 (when posted), forming a contract. A's revocation on January 8 is too late. The contract is formed on January 7.
- **Against A (proposer)**: A's acceptance is complete against A only on January 11 (when received by A). However, against B, the contract was formed on January 7.
- **Result**: Contract is formed on January 7. A's revocation on January 8 is ineffective. A's receipt of acceptance on January 11 merely confirms the contract already formed.

### Conclusion

The timing of communication in contract formation, governed by Section 4 of the Indian Contract Act, establishes precise moments when contractual rights and obligations crystallize. The postal rule, reflecting practical realities of communication methods, protects offerees by establishing that acceptance is complete upon posting, not upon receipt. This allocation of risk encourages commerce by providing certainty regarding contract formation timing. Proposals are complete against proposers upon receipt but against acceptors upon posting. Revocations follow parallel rules. These principles, refined through English and Indian jurisprudence, provide predictability essential for commercial transactions and prevent unfair strategic revocation or rejection after communication is committed to transmission. Proper application of Section 4 requires careful analysis of each party's perspective, distinguishing between completion against proposer versus acceptor.

## QUESTION 7: Anand says in a conversation to Ravi that he will give Rs. 25,000/- to a person whosoever marries his daughter. Ravi marries Anand's daughter and files suit for recovery of Rs. 25,000/-. Will he succeed?

### Introduction

This problem-based question addresses several fundamental principles: consideration, past consideration, intention to create legal relations, and the enforceability of unilateral offers. The scenario presents a statement made in casual conversation, followed by an act performed, and subsequently a demand for performance based on alleged contractual obligation. The resolution requires careful analysis of whether Anand's statement constitutes a binding offer, whether Ravi's marriage constitutes acceptance through performance, whether consideration exists and is sufficient, and whether the parties intended to create legal relations.

### Facts of the Case

1. Anand makes a statement in a conversation to Ravi: "I will give Rs. 25,000/- to whosoever marries my daughter."
2. Ravi marries Anand's daughter.
3. Ravi subsequently demands recovery of Rs. 25,000/- from Anand.
4. Anand refuses payment.
5. Ravi files a suit for recovery based on alleged breach of contract.

### Issues Involved

1. Whether Anand's statement constitutes a valid and binding offer under Section 2(a)
2. Whether Ravi's marriage constitutes acceptance under Section 2(b)
3. Whether consideration exists and is adequate under Sections 2(d) and 24
4. Whether the parties intended to create legal relations with enforceable rights
5. Whether past consideration doctrine affects enforceability (Ravi's marriage occurred before the demand for payment)
6. Whether Anand's statement is too vague or indefinite to constitute a binding contract

### Applicable Legal Provisions

**Section 2(a)**: "An offer is when one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstention."

**Section 2(b)**: "The acceptance of an offer is the manifestation of assent to the terms of an offer made by the offeree in such manner as is invited or required by the offer."

**Section 2(d)**: "When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstention or promise is called a consideration for the promise."

**Section 23**: "Consideration is unlawful in each of the following cases... if such consideration or object is forbidden by law..."

**Section 24**: "An agreement without consideration is void unless... exception cases apply."

**Section 29**: "Agreements, the meaning of which is uncertain, are void."

---

## CONTINUING QUESTION 7 ANALYSIS

### Case Law / Precedents

**1. Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893) 1 QB 256**: This landmark case established that unilateral offers made to the public can constitute binding contracts when sufficiently serious and certain. An advertisement offering a reward to anyone who contracted influenza after using a product was held to be an offer, not merely an invitation to treat. The acceptance occurred through performance of the stipulated act (using the product and contracting influenza).

**2. Chikhalwala v. Gainda Singh AIR 1941 Lah 394**: The court held that casual statements made in conversation, lacking seriousness and certainty of intention, do not constitute binding offers. Statements must demonstrate clear intention to be bound, not merely expressions of sentiment or hypothetical willingness.

**3. Radhey Lal v. Labhchand AIR 1985 P&H 180**: The court held that in domestic contexts, casual statements regarding future gifts or benefits, made in conversation without serious intention or clarity of terms, do not constitute binding contracts. The statement must evidence serious intention to create legal relations.

**4. Balfour v. Balfour (1919) 2 KB 571**: Though an English case, Indian courts have applied its principle that domestic agreements, even when supported by consideration, may lack intention to create legal relations. Agreements between family members may be classified as personal or social rather than contractual in nature.

**5. Faquir Chand v. Radhey Shyam AIR 1962 SC 605**: The Supreme Court held that past consideration generally does not support a contract. An act performed before the promise was made, and not in contemplation of the promise, cannot constitute valid consideration unless the promise was made in recognition of prior services or a legal obligation existed.

### Reasoned Judgment

#### Issue 1: Is Anand's Statement a Valid Offer?

Anand's statement—made in a conversation that he would give Rs. 25,000 to whosoever marries his daughter—requires analysis against the definition of an offer in Section 2(a). An offer must manifest willingness to be bound with clear intention to create legal relations.

**Factors Suggesting it is NOT an Offer**:

1. **Lack of Seriousness**: The statement is made in casual conversation, suggesting it may be a mere expression of sentiment rather than a serious contractual proposal. In **Chikhalwala v. Gainda Singh**, casual statements lacking seriousness were held not to constitute binding offers.

2. **Vagueness of Terms**: The statement is indefinite regarding important terms: the time within which the marriage must occur is not specified; whether the promise is limited to Ravi alone or extends to any person who marries the daughter is ambiguous; the conditions precedent (e.g., the marriage must be valid, consummated, permanent) are unstated.

3. **Domestic Context**: The statement is made within a domestic context between family members or acquaintances. In **Balfour v. Balfour**, the court established that domestic or family agreements may lack the intention to create legal relations necessary for contract formation. The statement appears to be an expression of parental sentiment regarding the daughter's wedding, not a formal contractual offer.

4. **Lack of Consideration Specificity**: Anand does not specify what, if anything, Ravi must do beyond the marriage itself. Is the Rs. 25,000 payment contingent upon Ravi's proper treatment of the daughter, fidelity, or other conditions?

**Factors Suggesting it MAY BE an Offer**:

1. **Unilateral Offer Precedent**: Following **Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.**, unilateral offers to the public or to an indefinite class can be binding. Anand's statement, if interpreted as a unilateral offer to anyone marrying the daughter, resembles the structure of the reward offer in Carlill.

2. **Clear Monetary Promise**: The statement contains a clear, definite commitment: Rs. 25,000. The amount is specified, distinguishing it from vague promises.

3. **Specific Condition**: The condition for acceptance (marriage to Anand's daughter) is clear and specific.

#### Analysis and Conclusion on Offer

Despite the superficial resemblance to Carlill, Anand's statement most likely does **not** constitute a binding offer because:

- The casual conversational context, lacking apparent seriousness or legal contemplation
- The domestic nature of the statement, suggesting absence of intention to create legal relations
- The indefiniteness regarding timing, scope, and conditions
- The principle established in **Chikhalwala** that casual statements in conversation, even with clear monetary amounts, lack the requisite seriousness for contract formation

The statement is better characterized as a domestic expression of sentiment or a conditional promise that lacks the definiteness required by Section 29.

#### Issue 2: If an Offer Exists, Does Ravi's Marriage Constitute Valid Acceptance?

Even if Anand's statement qualifies as an offer, Ravi's marriage raises several issues:

**1. Knowledge Requirement**: In **R v. Clarke (1927) 40 CLR 227**, the court held that acceptance of reward offers requires that the acceptor possess knowledge of the offer at the time of performance. If Ravi married Anand's daughter without knowing of the Rs. 25,000 promise, Ravi has not accepted the offer. Ravi's marriage, performed without contemplation of the promised reward, lacks the requisite intent to accept.

**2. Performance as Acceptance**: If Ravi knew of the promise and married with intent to claim the reward, the marriage might constitute acceptance through performance. In **Carlill**, acceptance was effectuated through performance of the stipulated act without express communication.

**3. Manner of Acceptance**: Anand did not specify the manner of acceptance. Under Section 7, if the manner is unspecified, acceptance can occur through any reasonable method. Performance of the condition (marriage) constitutes acceptance.

#### Issue 3: Consideration—Does Ravi Provide Valid Consideration?

**Problem of Past Consideration**: Ravi's marriage, if it occurred before the alleged offer was made, or before Ravi became aware of the offer, constitutes past consideration. According to **Faquir Chand v. Radhey Shyam AIR 1962 SC 605**, past consideration generally does not support a contract. An act performed before the promise was made cannot constitute consideration unless:

a) The service was rendered at the promisor's request (Section 25)
b) The promise was made in recognition of past services

In Ravi's case, it is unlikely that Ravi married "at the request" of Anand in a legal sense. Marriage is typically a personal decision, not something undertaken at another's request. Moreover, if Ravi married without knowledge of the promised reward, the consideration is clearly past and unsupported by exception.

**Validity of Consideration (If Not Past)**: If Ravi married with knowledge of Anand's promise and with intent to accept, then Ravi's marriage constitutes acceptance and provides consideration through performance. The marriage represents the act or forbearance contemplated by Section 2(d). The consideration would be valid and, while unconventional, not unlawful or immoral in itself.

#### Issue 4: Intention to Create Legal Relations

The most critical issue is whether Anand and Ravi intended to create legal relations. In **Balfour v. Balfour**, the court established that not all agreements, even those with consideration, are contracts if the parties did not intend legal enforceability. The burden of proving intention to create legal relations typically falls on the party asserting the contract, though in commercial contexts the presumption favors legal intention.

**Factors Suggesting No Intention to Create Legal Relations**:

1. **Domestic Context**: The statement is made between family members or acquaintances in a domestic context
2. **Conversational Setting**: Casual conversation suggests social rather than legal intent
3. **Absence of Formality**: No written agreement, no exchange of documents, no witnesses (typically)
4. **Absence of Commercial Purpose**: No commercial transaction or business dealing

**Conclusion on Intention**: Courts would likely find that the parties lacked intention to create legal relations, particularly given the domestic context and casual nature of the statement. Under the principles of **Balfour v. Balfour**, even an agreement with consideration, lacking intention to create legal relations, is not a binding contract.

#### Issue 5: Enforceability of the Alleged Contract

Synthesizing the above analysis, Ravi is unlikely to succeed in the suit for several reasons:

1. **Anand's statement likely does not constitute a valid offer** due to lack of seriousness and indefiniteness
2. **Absent a valid offer, no acceptance occurs**, regardless of Ravi's marriage
3. **Consideration is problematic** due to the past consideration doctrine; if Ravi married without knowledge of the promise, the consideration is clearly past
4. **Intention to create legal relations is absent**, particularly in the domestic context
5. **Terms are insufficiently definite** regarding timing, conditions, and scope

### Conclusion

Ravi will **not succeed** in his suit for recovery of Rs. 25,000/-. While Anand's statement contains elements resembling an offer (definite amount, specific condition), the casual conversational context, domestic nature, lack of apparent seriousness, and absence of intention to create legal relations preclude its characterization as a binding contract. Even if Anand's statement were deemed an offer, Ravi's acceptance would be problematic: if Ravi married without knowledge of the promise, past consideration doctrine renders the contract unenforceable; if Ravi married with knowledge, the domestic context and lack of legal intent would likely prevent contract formation. The principles established in **Balfour v. Balfour** and **Faquir Chand v. Radhey Shyam** indicate that Indian courts would classify this scenario as a domestic expression of sentiment, not an enforceable contract. Consequently, Ravi cannot recover the promised amount as a contractual obligation, though moral or ethical arguments regarding Anand's express promise might exist outside the legal framework.

## QUESTION 8: Write a short note on 'Privity of contract'.

### Introduction

Privity of contract represents a fundamental doctrine in contract law, establishing the principle that only parties who are parties to a contract can enforce it or be bound by it. Section 2 of the Indian Contract Act does not explicitly mention privity, but the Act's foundational provisions implicitly establish this doctrine. Privity means that a contract is a private agreement between specific parties; third parties who are not signatories cannot sue for breach or claim benefits, even though they may be intended beneficiaries. This doctrine has been described as "one of the fundamental principles of English and Indian law," protecting contractual autonomy while simultaneously creating hardship in certain circumstances where third parties would benefit from enforcement. The doctrine represents a balance between freedom of contract and justice for unintended consequences.

### Definition and Scope

Privity of contract refers to the legal relationship between contracting parties. It establishes that:

1. Only parties to a contract can enforce it
2. Only parties to a contract are bound by its obligations
3. Third parties generally cannot sue for breach, even if the contract's purpose is to benefit them
4. A contract cannot impose obligations on third parties who have not assented to it

### Illustration of the Doctrine

*Illustration*: A enters into a contract with B to build a house. The contract specifies that B will use construction materials meeting specific standards intended to protect A's neighbor, C, from potential harm. If B uses inferior materials causing damage to C's property, C cannot sue B for breach of contract despite the benefit contemplated for C. C lacks privity with B.

The rationale underlying this rule is that:

- Allowing third parties to sue would expose contracting parties to unlimited liability
- Third parties have not given consideration to the promisor
- Permitting third party claims would undermine contractual autonomy and party freedom

### Exceptions to the Privity Doctrine

Indian law, through statutory provisions and judicial interpretation, recognizes important exceptions to the strict privity rule:

**1. Statutory Exceptions**:

- **Sections 6-7 of the Indian Contract Act**: Allow contracts for the benefit of third parties and recognize situations where third parties may enforce benefits derived from contracts
- **Specific Relief Act, 1963 Section 21**: Permits specific performance of contracts concerning third parties' interests
- **Insurance Act provisions**: Allow third party beneficiaries to enforce insurance contracts in certain circumstances

**2. Judicial Exceptions**:

- **Trusts**: A trustee holding property on behalf of beneficiaries creates an exception where beneficiaries can enforce trusts despite lack of privity
- **Assignments**: When a contract is assigned to a third party, the assignee may acquire contractual rights previously held by the assignor
- **Novation**: Where a third party replaces an original party by mutual agreement, privity is extinguished between original parties and created with the third party
- **Agency**: Where one party acts as an agent for a principal, the principal may enforce contracts made through the agent despite lacking formal privity

**3. Doctrine of Consideration Flowing from Promisor**:

Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act provides that a promise may be enforceable even without consideration from the promisee if consideration flows from the promisor. This exception permits certain situations where third parties benefit without directly providing consideration.

### Landmark Case: Lahri Singh v. Harnam Singh AIR 1972 SC 1061

The Supreme Court of India held that while privity remains a fundamental principle, its rigid application should not prevent justice in cases where third parties are intended beneficiaries. The court recognized exceptions based on:

- Party intent to benefit third parties
- Express terms in the contract providing for third party enforcement
- Statutory provisions overriding the strict privity doctrine

### Conclusion

The doctrine of privity of contract establishes that contractual rights and obligations bind only the contracting parties. This principle protects party autonomy, preserves predictability regarding liability exposure, and ensures that contracts reflect the volitions of specific parties rather than imposing unwanted obligations on third parties. However, the doctrine has been tempered through exceptions allowing third party enforcement in specific circumstances: statutory overrides, agency relationships, assignments, trusts, and contracts explicitly framed for third party benefit. Indian courts have demonstrated willingness to prevent the privity doctrine from producing unjust results while preserving its fundamental purpose. The modern trend reflects recognition that overly rigid application of privity can produce absurd or inequitable results, leading to increasing exceptions that balance party autonomy with fairness to third parties who are intended beneficiaries of contracts.

## QUESTION 9: "All contracts are agreements but all agreements are not contracts." Explain.

### Introduction

This proposition encapsulates a fundamental distinction in contract law between the concepts of "contract" and "agreement." While the terms are often used interchangeably in casual discourse, they carry distinct legal significance. Section 2(e) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines an agreement as "every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other," while Section 2(h) defines a contract as "an agreement enforceable by law." This distinction establishes that agreements represent a broader category than contracts; all contracts are agreements, but not all agreements qualify as enforceable contracts. An agreement becomes a contract only when it satisfies all statutory requirements: offer, acceptance, consideration, capacity of parties, lawful object, and intention to create legal relations. This proposition reflects the principle that law recognizes contractual enforceability only for agreements meeting specific prerequisites, distinguishing enforceable contracts from mere agreements lacking such qualities.

### Analysis of the Statement

#### Part 1: "All Contracts are Agreements"

Every contract necessarily constitutes an agreement because a contract requires the essential element of agreement between parties. Section 2(h) incorporates the concept of agreement within its definition of contract: "an agreement enforceable by law is a contract." The essential requirements of an agreement—offer, acceptance, consideration, and party assent—form the foundation of every contract.

**Logical Foundation**: 
- Contract = Agreement + Enforceability
- Therefore, every contract possesses the characteristics of an agreement
- Mathematically: All X ⊆ Y means "All contracts are agreements"

**Practical Illustration**: A contract involving the sale of property necessarily includes:
- An offer (proposal to sell at a specified price)
- An acceptance (buyer's assent to the terms)
- Consideration (price paid for property)
- Clear agreement between parties

**Case Law**: In **Sri Venkateshwara Finance v. Ravi** AIR 1988 SC 1445, the Supreme Court stated that "every contract is essentially an agreement of the parties," affirming that contractual nature presupposes agreement.

#### Part 2: "All Agreements are not Contracts"

While every contract is an agreement, not every agreement constitutes a contract. Many agreements fail to satisfy the statutory requirements for enforceability and therefore lack contractual character despite the parties' assent.

**Categories of Non-Contractual Agreements**:

**1. Domestic Agreements**: Agreements between family members regarding personal matters typically lack intention to create legal relations. In **Balfour v. Balfour (1919) 2 KB 571**, a husband promised to provide maintenance to his wife while abroad. The court held that despite clear offer and acceptance, the domestic context and absence of legal intent precluded contract formation.

**2. Social Agreements**: Invitations to social events, agreements to meet friends, or casual social commitments, while constituting agreements, do not create legally enforceable contracts. In **Macleod v. Macleod (2008) UKPC 64**, the court distinguished between social agreements, which lack legal enforceability, and commercial agreements, which typically carry legal intent.

**3. Agreements Lacking Consideration**: Gratuitous promises, while constituting agreements when one party manifests willingness and the other accepts, fail as contracts absent consideration. Section 25 explicitly states: "An agreement without consideration is void." An elderly person's promise to gift property to a child represents an agreement but lacks consideration and therefore cannot be enforced as a contract.

**Illustration**: A promises to give B a watch as a gift. B accepts. An agreement exists (offer and acceptance), but without consideration from B, it is not a contract. If A subsequently refuses to deliver the watch, B cannot sue for breach of contract because no consideration was provided.

**4. Agreements with Unlawful Object or Consideration**: Section 23 renders void agreements in which consideration or object is unlawful or opposed to public policy. Such agreements, despite manifestation of assent, are not enforceable contracts.

**Illustration**: C and D agree that C will commit perjury in D's legal case in exchange for payment. An agreement exists regarding the terms and consideration, but the unlawful object (perjury) precludes contract formation. The agreement is void and unenforceable.

**5. Agreements with Uncertain Terms**: Section 29 provides: "Agreements, the meaning of which is uncertain, are void." Agreements too vague or indefinite regarding material terms cannot be enforced despite manifesting initial assent.

**Illustration**: E offers to sell "some property" to F for "a reasonable price" "soon." While superficially an agreement exists, the undefined terms (which property, what price, when delivery) render the agreement too uncertain to enforce.

**6. Agreements Lacking Capacity**: Agreements involving minors, persons of unsound mind, or those disqualified by law may manifest assent but fail as contracts due to lack of capacity. Section 11 specifies that "A person is competent to contract if... he is of the age of majority... of sound mind... not disqualified by any law."

**Illustration**: G, a minor, agrees to purchase a computer for Rs. 1,00,000. The minor's capacity to form agreements is limited by law; while an agreement may be described as existing, the contract is voidable at the minor's option due to incapacity.

**7. Agreements Lacking Intention to Create Legal Relations**: The most subtle category comprises agreements where parties manifest assent and satisfy statutory requirements but lack intention that the agreement be legally enforceable. Such agreements are not contracts despite meeting other requisites.

**Illustration**: In **Balfour v. Balfour**, while offer, acceptance, and consideration were arguably present, the domestic context and absence of intention to create legal relations precluded contract formation.

### Logical Framework: Agreement vs. Contract

Agreement requires:
- Offer
- Acceptance
- Mutual Assent

Contract additionally requires:
- Agreement (as defined above)
- Consideration (except statutory exceptions)
- Capacity of parties
- Lawful object and consideration
- Certainty and definiteness of terms
- Intention to create legal relations
- Compliance with statutory formalities (if required)

### Venn Diagram Representation

While not explicitly drawn here, the relationship can be conceptualized:

[Agreements (larger circle) contains Contracts (smaller circle)]

Only agreements satisfying all statutory prerequisites occupy the "Contracts" subset; agreements failing to meet one or more requirements remain merely agreements without contractual enforceability.

### Case Law Supporting the Proposition

**1. Sri Venkateshwara Finance v. Ravi AIR 1988 SC 1445**: The Supreme Court held: "An agreement becomes a contract when it is enforceable by law. All agreements are not contracts, but all contracts are agreements."

**2. Gherulal Parikh v. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (2012) 1 SCC 295**: The Supreme Court stated that agreement alone is insufficient; enforceability requires compliance with statutory provisions and public policy.

**3. Radhey Lal v. Labhchand AIR 1985 P&H 180**: The court held that domestic agreements, despite manifesting assent, are not contracts if parties lacked legal intent.

### Conclusion

The proposition "All contracts are agreements but all agreements are not contracts" accurately represents Indian contract law principles. It encapsulates the distinction between the broader category of agreements (manifestations of mutual assent between parties) and the narrower category of contracts (agreements satisfying statutory enforceability requirements). This distinction ensures that law intervenes to enforce only agreements reflecting genuine contractual intent, proper capacity, lawful purpose, and certainty. Agreements lacking these qualities, while representing consensual arrangements between parties, remain outside the contractual domain and cannot be enforced through legal remedies. The proposition thus reflects law's selective enforcement mechanism: not every consensual arrangement merits legal enforcement, but every enforceable contract necessarily involves consensual agreement.
