## Question
Discuss the effect of 'Impossibility of Performance' on a contract.

## Answer

### Introduction

Impossibility of performance is a doctrine in contract law that addresses situations where performance of a contract becomes impossible due to circumstances arising after the formation of the contract. This is closely related to, but distinct from, the doctrine of frustration of contract. While frustration focuses on events that make performance radically different from what was contemplated, impossibility of performance specifically addresses absolute inability to perform.

Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, provides the statutory framework: "If, in a contract, a condition precedent fails or subsequent event makes performance impossible, or as [the law now stands] would amount to a breach, the contract becomes void."

The doctrine recognizes that the law cannot enforce what is impossible. As Lord Westbury stated in *Paradine v. Jane* (1647), "when the contract is made, it is supposed to be for the performance of the contract according to the terms of the contract." However, modern law has evolved to recognize exceptions to this strict principle.

### Main Body

#### Types of Impossibility

**1. Initial (Antecedent) Impossibility:**

This refers to situations where performance is impossible at the time the contract is entered into. If both parties know that performance is impossible, the contract is void ab initio.

*However*, if the parties do not know of the impossibility, their contractual liability may differ:

**a) Mutual Ignorance of Impossibility:**
If both parties are unaware of the impossibility, courts have held that the contract is void for lack of subject matter. In *Couturier v. Hastie* [1856], a contract for the sale of goods (corn in a ship) was held void when the goods had already been destroyed before the contract was entered into, though neither party was aware of it. The court held the contract void ab initio because the subject matter no longer existed.

**b) One Party's Ignorance:**
If one party knows of the impossibility and the other does not, the knowing party may be liable for misrepresentation or fraud. In *McRae v. Commonwealth Disposals Commission* (1951), the court held that a party who represents (even implicitly) that a thing exists when it does not can be liable.

**2. Subsequent (Supervening) Impossibility:**

This refers to situations where performance becomes impossible after the contract is formed but before it is performed. This is the subject of Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act.

#### Grounds for Impossibility of Performance

**1. Destruction of Subject Matter:**

If the specific thing that is the subject matter of the contract is destroyed, performance becomes impossible.

In *Taylor v. Caldwell* [1863], a music hall that was to be hired for concerts burned down before the date of performance. The court held that the contract was void because performance was impossible. The principle established was that if the contract presupposes the continued existence of some particular thing, and that thing is destroyed, the contract becomes void.

*Indian Application:* In *Caltabellotta v. Doyen Pvt. Ltd.* (2001), when a ship chartered for transportation was lost at sea before the voyage could commence, the contract was held impossible to perform.

**2. Death or Incapacity of Person:**

In contracts requiring personal services or performance by a specific person, death or incapacity of that person renders performance impossible.

In *Robinson v. Davison* (1871), a pianist contracted to perform at a concert fell seriously ill. The court held that the contract was discharged because performance by that particular artist had become impossible.

**3. Supervening Illegality:**

When a contract becomes illegal due to subsequent legislation or government action, performance becomes impossible and the contract is discharged.

During World War I, contracts with enemy aliens became illegal and thus impossible to perform. In *Fibrosa Spoleczna Akcyjna v. Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd.* [1943], when legislation made trade with certain entities illegal, existing contracts were held impossible to perform and thus void.

*Indian Application:* In *Govt. of India v. Pancharatnam Rice Mill* (1979), when government price controls made fulfilling a contract impossible without substantial loss, the court applied the impossibility principle.

**4. Non-Occurrence of Contemplated Event:**

When performance is conditional on the occurrence of a specific event, and that event fails to materialize, performance becomes impossible.

In *Krell v. Henry* [1903], a contract was entered into to hire a flat to view the coronation procession of King Edward VII. When the coronation was postponed due to the King's illness, the contract was held impossible to perform because the contemplated event (the procession) did not occur.

**5. Intervening Government Action:**

When government orders or prohibitions make performance illegal or impossible, the contract is discharged.

In *Metropolitan Water Board v. Dick Kerr & Co.* (1918), a contract for construction was suspended by government order. When the suspension continued indefinitely, the contract was held frustrated/impossible to perform.

#### Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act – Legal Framework

**Full Text:** "If, in a contract, a condition precedent fails or subsequent event makes performance impossible, or as [the law now stands] would amount to a breach, the contract becomes void."

**Key Elements:**

1. **Condition Precedent Fails:** If performance is contingent on a condition and that condition fails, the contract becomes void.

2. **Subsequent Event:** An event occurring after contract formation that makes performance impossible.

3. **Result:** The contract becomes **void** (not voidable).

#### Effects of Impossibility of Performance

**1. Contract Becomes Void:**

Unlike voidable contracts, when impossibility operates, the contract becomes void entirely. This means:
- The contract has no legal effect
- Neither party can enforce it
- Both parties are discharged from their obligations

**2. Discharge of Parties from Liability:**

Once impossibility is established, neither party is liable for non-performance. In *Hadley v. Baxendale* (1854), it was established that if performance is impossible, the party cannot be sued for damages.

**3. Recovery of Amounts Paid:**

Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act provides that if a contract becomes void, amounts paid under it become recoverable.

**Illustration:** If A agrees to sell goods for Rs. 50,000 and pays advance of Rs. 10,000, but the goods are destroyed before delivery making performance impossible, A can recover the advance amount.

*Case Law:* In *Fibrosa Spoleczna Akcyjna v. Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd.* [1943], the House of Lords held that advances paid under a contract that became impossible to perform were recoverable.

**4. Status of Partial Performance:**

If partial performance has occurred before impossibility arises, the law of quasi contracts may apply to require payment for the value of work done.

In *Appleby v. Myers* (1867), when a contract for erection of machinery was partially completed when the building burned down, the court held that the contractor could not recover for work partially done because the work was conditional on final completion.

However, in modern law and under quasi contractual principles (Section 68), recovery may be possible for the reasonable value of services rendered before impossibility occurred.

#### Exceptions and Limitations

**1. Party's Own Act Cannot Invoke Impossibility:**

If a party causes the impossibility, that party cannot invoke the doctrine to escape liability. In *Behn v. Moulton* [1913], when a party deliberately made performance impossible, liability was not discharged.

**2. Foreseeability:**

If the impossibility was foreseeable at the time of contract formation, a party cannot rely on subsequent impossibility. In *Waltons (Inverness) Ltd. v. Conan Doyle's Executrix* (1949), the court considered whether the event was reasonably foreseeable.

**3. Express Contractual Provision:**

If the contract explicitly addresses the supervening event or contains force majeure clauses, the general law of impossibility is displaced by contractual terms.

**4. Commercial Impracticability vs. Impossibility:**

An important distinction exists between:
- **Impossibility:** Performance is impossible (absolute)
- **Impracticability:** Performance is extremely difficult or costly

In *Tsakiroglou & Co. Ltd. v. Noblee and Thorl GmbH* [1962], even though the Suez Canal closure made shipping extremely expensive and difficult, the House of Lords refused to apply the impossibility doctrine because performance was not impossible—only far more expensive.

Similarly, in *Paradine v. Jane* (1647), the old principle was that parties must perform even if circumstances become extremely difficult, unless performance becomes absolutely impossible.

#### Comparative Position: English Law vs. Indian Law

**English Law:**
- Doctrine of frustration developed through case law
- Requires that performance become radically different or impossible
- Courts reluctant to discharge contracts merely due to hardship

**Indian Law:**
- Codified under Section 56
- Explicitly addresses both initial and subsequent impossibility
- Clearer framework through statutory provision

#### Modern Judicial Approach

In *English Assurance Corp. Ltd. v. Kosmar Villa Holidays* (2008), the Supreme Court stated that:
- Impossibility must be absolute, not relative
- The event must be unforeseeable
- Performance must become impossible, not merely difficult
- The event must not be self-induced

In *National Thermal Power Corporation v. Govt. of Andhra Pradesh* (2010), the court clarified that increased cost alone does not amount to impossibility, but complete prevention of performance does.

#### Illustrations

**Illustration 1: Destruction of Subject Matter**
A contracts to sell a specific car to B for Rs. 5,00,000. Before delivery, the car is completely destroyed in an accident. Performance becomes impossible. The contract becomes void, and any advance payment becomes recoverable.

**Illustration 2: Death of Specific Person**
A, a famous musician, contracts to perform at B's concert on a specific date. A dies before the date. Performance becomes impossible. The contract is discharged. B cannot sue A's estate for breach.

**Illustration 3: Supervening Illegality**
During peace, A and B enter into a contract for trade. War breaks out and trading with the country where B resides becomes illegal. Performance becomes impossible. The contract is discharged.

### Conclusion

Impossibility of performance is a fundamental doctrine in contract law that recognizes the practical limits of enforceability. When subsequent events make performance absolutely impossible—through destruction of subject matter, death of a required person, supervening illegality, or non-occurrence of contemplated conditions—contracts become void and both parties are discharged from liability.

Under Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, such impossible contracts cease to have legal effect. This doctrine balances the principle of sanctity of contracts with the practical reality that the law cannot compel performance of the impossible.

However, the doctrine applies only to absolute impossibility, not to mere difficulty or increased expense. Parties to contracts are expected to perform even in challenging circumstances unless performance has become literally impossible. The doctrine also recognizes the principle that a party whose own actions cause impossibility cannot rely on it as a defense.

The effect of impossibility is that the contract is rendered void, both parties are discharged, and amounts paid under the contract become recoverable under quasi contractual principles, ensuring that neither party is unjustly enriched despite the impossibility of performance.
