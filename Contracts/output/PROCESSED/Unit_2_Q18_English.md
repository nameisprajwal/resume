## Question
What is 'Undue Influence'? Explain the circumstances under which the relation between the parties are presumed to be one of 'Undue Influence'.

## Answer

### Introduction

Undue influence is a vitiating factor that undermines the free consent essential to valid contracts. Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, defines undue influence and establishes the legal framework for recognizing situations where one party has improperly influenced another to enter into a contract.

The doctrine reflects the law's recognition that some relationships create inherent power imbalances, making the weaker party vulnerable to exploitation. This answer explores the concept of undue influence, the circumstances creating presumptions of undue influence, and the burden of proof.

### Main Body

#### Definition of Undue Influence

**Section 15 Definition:**
"(1) A person is said to be under 'undue influence' with respect to another if—
(i) he holds a position of dominance over the mind of that other; or
(ii) he is in a relation, the circumstances of which are such that he is presumed to hold so much influence over that other; and
(3) Whatever difficulty may be experienced in the display of undue influence or in ascertaining its exact nature in each individual case, yet the essential idea is, by asserting a dominating influence of the human will, to prevent the exercise of an independent volition by another."

**Key Elements:**
1. **Position of Dominance:** Over the mind of the other party
2. **Actual Influence:** Direct exercise of influence, OR
3. **Presumed Influence:** Relationship creates presumption of dominance
4. **Resulting Incapacity:** Prevents independent exercise of will

#### Distinction from Coercion

**Coercion (Section 15):**
- Involves use of force/threat
- Direct pressure on person
- Easily provable

**Undue Influence (Section 16):**
- Exercise of mental/moral dominance
- Subtle and indirect
- Requires proof of relationship or circumstances

**Case Law:** In *Allcard v. Skinner* (1887), the court distinguished between coercion (physical compulsion) and undue influence (moral pressure).

#### Circumstances Creating Presumption of Undue Influence

**Section 16(2) - Presumed Relations:**

The statute creates presumptions of undue influence in the following relationships:

**1. Parent and Child:**

The relationship between parent and child is presumed to create undue influence. In *Poosapati Veerrayya v. Suryaprakasam Rao* (1967), the Supreme Court held that a parent's authority over a child, even after majority, creates an inherent presumption of influence.

**Requirements for Presumption:**
- Parent-child relationship must be established
- Transaction occurred while this relationship existed
- Financial or beneficial transaction involved
- Proof of actual undue influence not required (presumption applies)

**Burden of Proof:** Once parent-child relationship is proved, the parent must rebut the presumption by showing:
- Full information was given to the child
- Child received independent advice
- Transaction was for child's benefit
- Child acted freely

**2. Physician and Patient:**

The physician-patient relationship creates presumption of undue influence because of the patient's vulnerability and dependence on medical expertise. In *Tate v. Williamson* [1866], the court recognized physician influence over patients.

**Illustration:** If a doctor persuades a patient to gift property for medical treatment, undue influence is presumed.

**3. Religious Advisor and Follower:**

The relationship between spiritual advisors and followers creates presumption. In *Allcard v. Skinner* (1887), a woman made large gifts to a convent following advice of a spiritual director. The court held undue influence was presumed.

**Circumstances Showing Presumption:**
- Spiritual authority over follower
- Follower's trust in spiritual guidance
- Follower's vulnerability
- Religious dependency

**4. Solicitor and Client:**

The solicitor-client relationship creates presumption because of the client's dependence on legal expertise. In *Geisinger v. Geisinger* (1886), substantial gifts to a solicitor were presumed to result from undue influence.

**Application:** If a solicitor drafting a will persuades a client to include the solicitor as beneficiary, undue influence is presumed.

**5. Guardian and Ward:**

The guardian-ward relationship creates clear presumption. In *Markandeya v. Govindrao* (1935), the court held that guardians hold special position over wards.

**Burden on Guardian:** The guardian must prove the transaction was:
- For ward's benefit
- Made with full information
- Free from influence

**6. Bank and Customer (Creditor-Debtor):**

In some cases, the creditor-debtor relationship creates presumption, particularly when:
- Creditor has financial hold over debtor
- Debtor is desperate
- Transaction heavily favors creditor

In *United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Brunet* [1908], the court recognized undue influence in creditor-debtor relations.

#### Circumstances Showing Actual (Not Presumed) Undue Influence

Beyond presumed relationships, undue influence can be proved through evidence of:

**1. Dominating Influence:**
Evidence that one party has exercised dominance over the other's mind. In *Huguenin v. Baseley* (1807), the court found undue influence from circumstances showing mental dominance.

**2. Dependency Relationship:**
Not necessarily a legal or professional relationship, but a factual dependence. In *Inche Noriah v. Shaik Allie Bin Omar* [1929], undue influence was found based on factual dependence despite no formal relationship.

**3. Confidential Relationship:**
Where one party reposes complete confidence in another. In *Allcard v. Skinner* (1887), the confidential nature of the relationship was crucial to finding undue influence.

**4. Susceptibility Factors:**
- Advanced age
- Illness or weakness
- Lack of education
- Isolation from others
- Emotional or financial vulnerability

**5. Suspicious Circumstances:**
- Sudden change in testamentary intentions
- Unusual transaction favoring influencer
- Secrecy surrounding transaction
- Influencer isolated the parties from others

**Case Application:** In *Mohan Singh v. Lakshmi Narain* (1974), the court found undue influence through evidence of:
- Vulnerable position of elderly person
- Sudden gift to person providing care
- Isolation from family
- Suspicious timing

#### Burden and Standard of Proof

**Initial Burden:**

The burden depends on the relationship:

1. **Presumed Relationships:** Burden shifts to the dominant party to rebut presumption once plaintiff shows:
   - The relationship existed
   - The transaction occurred
   - The transaction was beneficial to the presumed influencer

2. **Non-Presumed Relationships:** Plaintiff must prove actual undue influence by:
   - Direct evidence of coercion
   - Suspicious circumstances
   - Factual dependence

**Standard of Proof:**

Civil standard: Preponderance of probabilities (balance of probabilities), not beyond reasonable doubt.

In *Etridge (No. 2)* [2001], the House of Lords emphasized that undue influence need not be proved to criminal standard—civil standard applies.

#### Elements Necessary to Establish Actual Undue Influence

**1. Relationship of Trust:**
Plaintiff must show one party reposed trust/confidence in the other.

**2. Susceptibility:**
Plaintiff must show susceptibility to influence (age, health, education, dependency).

**3. Manifestation of Influence:**
Conduct or words showing actual exercise of influence.

**4. Causal Connection:**
Influence must be connected to the impugned transaction.

**5. Resulting Transaction:**
The transaction must be one unlikely to occur without the influence.

**Illustration:** An elderly man in poor health is constantly visited by his nephew. The nephew persuades him that his property should go to the nephew. The man makes a will leaving everything to the nephew. Elements:
- Relationship of trust (family)
- Susceptibility (age, health, isolation)
- Manifestation (constant visits, persuasion)
- Causation (influence led to will)
- Unusual result (disinheriting other family)

#### Effects of Undue Influence

**1. Contract is Voidable:**

Unlike void contracts, contracts procured through undue influence are voidable—valid until repudiated by the party influenced.

**2. Right of Rescission:**

The party influenced has the right to rescind the contract. In *Allcard v. Skinner* (1887), rescission was available even after delay in extreme cases.

**Bars to Rescission:**
- Affirmation (ratification)
- Lapse of time
- Third-party rights intervened
- Restitution impossible

**3. Restoration of Benefits:**

If the party repudiates, they must restore all benefits received. In *Clarke v. Dickson* (1858), restitution required even for partially used benefits.

#### Modern Judicial Approach

**Protective Interpretation:**

In *Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd. v. Aboody* [1992], the court took protective approach, recognizing that:
- Undue influence can exist outside traditional relationships
- Modern circumstances create dependencies
- Courts will examine substance, not form

**Indian Position:**

In *Chandra Prakash v. Chandra Prakash Saxena* (2009), the Supreme Court held that undue influence must be examined contextually:
- Nature of relationship
- Age and health of parties
- Economic dependency
- Factual circumstances

### Conclusion

Undue influence is a vitiating factor recognizing that some relationships create power imbalances enabling one party to dominate another's will. The statute creates presumptions of undue influence in specific relationships—parent-child, physician-patient, spiritual advisor-follower, solicitor-client, guardian-ward—shifting the burden to the dominant party to prove the transaction was free.

Beyond these presumed relationships, undue influence can be proved through evidence of actual dominance, dependency, suspicious circumstances, and susceptibility factors. Contracts procured through undue influence are voidable, giving the influenced party the right to rescind and restore benefits.

Modern courts have adopted protective interpretations, recognizing undue influence beyond formal relationships and examining the substance of transactions. This reflects the law's commitment to protecting vulnerable persons and ensuring that contractual consent is genuinely free and independent.
