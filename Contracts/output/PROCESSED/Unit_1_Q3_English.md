## Question
Explain the concept of 'General Offer'. How does it differ from an ordinary offer?

## Answer

### Definition

A general offer is an offer made to the world at large—to any person who comes forward and fulfills the conditions. It is a promise that becomes binding when the condition is fulfilled by any member of the public.

### Key Distinction from Ordinary Offer

**Ordinary Offer:**
- Made to specific person or identifiable group
- Creates privity between specific parties
- Terminated when rejected by that specific person

**General Offer:**
- Made to the world at large
- Anyone can accept by fulfilling conditions
- Creates multiple potential contracts with various acceptors

### Classic Case - Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. [1893]

The company advertised: "£100 reward to anyone who uses our smoke ball and catches flu." Carlill used the product and caught flu. The court held this was a general offer—Carlill could accept by fulfilling the condition (using the product and catching flu).

**Significance:** General offer is binding on the offeror when condition is fulfilled by any member of the public.

### Elements of Valid General Offer

1. **Intention to be bound:** Clear intent that acceptance would create contract
2. **Definite terms:** All material terms clearly specified
3. **Specific condition:** Identifiable condition that must be fulfilled
4. **Communication:** Adequately communicated to the public

### Examples

**Valid General Offers:**
- Reward offers: "£1,000 reward for return of lost dog"
- Prize competitions: "Rs. 50,000 for solution to this puzzle"
- Public tenders: "Supplies wanted—best bid to be accepted"

**Not General Offers:**
- Advertisements of goods (invitation to treat)
- Statements of price or availability
- Display of goods in shops

### Legal Consequences

- **Multiple Acceptances:** Multiple people can accept general offer
- **No Revocation (Complete):** Once someone accepts by fulfilling condition, offeror cannot revoke that acceptance
- **Revocation Notice:** Offeror can revoke by public notice (if not already accepted by someone)
- **Consideration:** Each fulfillment of condition is consideration for the offer

### Conclusion

General offers are unique in contract law because they allow multiple acceptances from the public. The distinction from ordinary offers is crucial—general offers don't require identification of specific acceptor, only that the condition be fulfilled. Once fulfilled by anyone, a binding contract arises.
