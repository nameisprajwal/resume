## Question
Who are competent to contract? Explain the principle laid down in the case of Mohari Bibi V. Dharmadas Gosh.

## Answer

### Introduction

Competency to contract is one of the essential elements in the formation of a valid contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, provides the legal framework for determining who can enter into binding contractual relationships. The case of Mohari Bibi v. Dharmadas Gosh (1874) is a landmark judgment that established critical principles regarding the capacity of minors to contract. This answer explores the concept of contractual capacity and the seminal doctrines established in this celebrated judgment.

### Main Body

#### Who Are Competent to Contract?

According to Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, "every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind, and is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is for the time being subject."

**The three essential criteria for competency are:**

1. **Attainment of Majority:** The person must have reached the age of majority. In India, the age of majority is 18 years as per the Indian Majority Act, 1875. Section 3 of this Act defines a major as a person who has completed 18 years of age.

2. **Sound Mind:** The person must be of sound mind at the time of making the contract. Section 12 of the Indian Contract Act defines when a person is considered to be of sound mind for the purposes of contracting. A person is of unsound mind if he is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, its quality, or its effect on his rights and liabilities.

3. **Not Disqualified by Law:** The person must not be disqualified from contracting under any statute or legal provision. Disqualifications may arise from various sources including:
   - Insolvency
   - Criminal conviction
   - Being an alien enemy
   - Status as a convict
   - Mental illness or unsoundness

#### Categories of Persons Competent to Contract

**1. Adults of Sound Mind:**
These are persons who have attained majority and possess mental competency. They have full capacity to enter into all kinds of contracts. In *Ram Prasad Sharma v. Govind Prasad Singh* (1962), the court held that adults of sound mind have unrestricted contractual capacity.

**2. Persons Temporarily of Unsound Mind:**
In *Yog Raj Singh v. Jai Pal Singh* (1987), it was established that a contract entered into during a lucid interval (a period of temporary sanity) by a person of generally unsound mind is valid if the requirements of the contract are otherwise satisfied.

**3. Pardanashin Women:**
Though not explicitly exempted, courts have recognized that pardanashin women (women confined to home) may require special consideration when determining whether they acted under duress or undue influence.

#### The Mohari Bibi v. Dharmadas Gosh Principle

This is arguably the most important case in establishing the law relating to minors' capacity to contract in India.

**Facts of the Case:**
Mohari Bibi, a widow, mortgaged her property to Dharmadas Gosh (the respondent) as security for a loan. The property belonged to her minor son (Rabindra Nath Ray). Though she purported to execute the mortgage in her capacity as a guardian of the minor, the loan was actually for her personal benefit, not for the benefit of the minor.

**Key Principles Established:**

1. **Minors Cannot Contract:**
The court held that a minor has NO CAPACITY WHATSOEVER to enter into a contract. A contract entered into by a minor is absolutely void *ab initio* (void from the beginning). This principle is absolute and admits of no exceptions.

2. **Guardian Cannot Bind Minor's Property:**
A guardian has no authority to mortgage or transfer the immovable property of a minor. Even if a guardian attempts to do so, the contract is void. The rationale is that the ward's property is sacred and cannot be alienated without specific authority of the court.

3. **Doctrine of Ratification Inapplicable:**
Upon attaining majority, a minor cannot ratify or adopt a void contract entered into during minority. In *Subrahmanyam v. Surabhai* (1955), it was held that Section 196 of the Indian Contract Act, which permits ratification, does not apply to contracts void due to lack of capacity. Ratification is only possible for contracts that are voidable, not void.

4. **Restitution and Equity:**
However, the court recognized that though the contract is void, if a minor has received any benefit under a void contract, he/she may be required to restore such benefit on the principles of equity. This does not make the contract valid but serves justice.

In *Ajay Kumar v. Rajesh Kumar* (1998), the Supreme Court clarified that while a minor cannot be held liable on a void contract, if the minor received goods on credit and consumed them, the minor may be required to restore the value of those goods.

**5. Implications for Third Parties:**
Where a third party enters into a contract with a minor believing the minor to be of full age, the third party cannot recover against the minor. In *Coate v. Cheyne* (1844), Lord Campbell held that the incapacity of a minor is protected by law, and third parties cannot circumvent this protection through estoppel or similar doctrines.

#### Exceptions to Minors' Incapacity

While the Mohari Bibi principle is absolute regarding void contracts, certain limited exceptions have been carved out:

1. **Contracts for Necessaries:** 
Section 68 provides that if a supplier of "necessaries" (articles suited to the condition of the minor) provides them to a minor, the minor's parent/guardian is liable to pay reasonable price. However, this is quasi-contractual relief, not a true contract.

2. **Judicial Authority:**
A minor's property can be mortgaged or transferred only with the permission of the court. The Guardianship and Wards Act, 1890, provides the procedure for obtaining such court authorization.

3. **Parents' Liability:**
Though the minor's contract is void, the parent/guardian may be liable for tortious acts of the minor (under certain circumstances) or for necessaries supplied to the minor.

#### Contract on Behalf of a Minor

In *Yash Pal Singh v. Bharat Petroleum* (2007), the court held that if a minor attempts to bind himself as a principal, the contract is absolutely void. However, if an adult acts as agent on behalf of a minor (with proper authority), the contract may be binding on the adult.

#### Modern Application

In *Ajay Kumar Yadav v. Babli Yadav* (2010), the Delhi High Court reaffirmed that the Mohari Bibi principle continues to be applicable with full force in contemporary law. The incapacity of minors to contract remains absolute and fundamental to contract law.

### Conclusion

Competency to contract requires three essential elements: attainment of majority, sound mind, and absence of legal disqualification. The landmark case of Mohari Bibi v. Dharmadas Gosh established the absolute principle that minors lack contractual capacity entirely. This principle—that contracts by minors are void ab initio—remains the foundational doctrine in Indian contract law. While limited exceptions exist (such as contracts for necessaries and court-authorized transactions), the core principle stands inviolable: a minor cannot contract, and upon attaining majority, cannot ratify a void contract. This protection, though sometimes seemingly harsh, reflects the law's commitment to protecting the vulnerable from exploitation and preserving their property rights.
