## Question
What is Quasi Contract? When does Quasi Contractual liability arise?

## Answer

### Introduction

Quasi contracts are an important concept in the law of contract that provide remedies in situations where no formal contract exists, yet one party is unjustly enriched at the expense of another. The term "quasi contract" means "as if a contract" - these are obligations imposed by law rather than created by the voluntary agreement of the parties. Sections 68-72 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, deal with quasi-contractual obligations. This answer explores the nature of quasi contracts, their distinguishing characteristics, and the circumstances under which quasi contractual liability arises.

### Main Body

#### Definition of Quasi Contract

A quasi contract is a legal obligation that arises by operation of law in the absence of any formal contract or agreement between the parties. It is a statutory obligation that obliges one person to pay money to another based on principles of equity and justice. In *Sinclair v. Brougham* [1914], the House of Lords defined quasi contracts as obligations which are created by the law independently of any agreement and arise from the receipt by the defendant of some benefit which he cannot in equity retain.

**Key Characteristics of Quasi Contracts:**

1. **No Formal Agreement:** Unlike ordinary contracts, quasi contracts do not rest on mutual assent of the parties. There is no offer and acceptance.

2. **Created by Law:** Quasi contractual obligations are created by law, not by the parties' voluntary agreement.

3. **Based on Equity:** The foundation of quasi contracts is equity and justice - to prevent unjust enrichment.

4. **Not Contracts Strictly:** While called "quasi contracts," they are not true contracts as they lack the essential element of agreement.

5. **One-Way Obligation:** Typically, quasi contracts create a one-way obligation on the defendant to pay the plaintiff, without reciprocal obligations.

#### Types of Quasi Contracts

**1. Supply of Necessaries (Section 68):**

When necessaries are supplied to a person incapable of contracting (such as a minor, person of unsound mind), the supplier is entitled to recover the reasonable price from the person's estate or property.

*Case Law:* In *Coate v. Cheyne* (1844), a minor received board and lodging. Though the minor could not contract, the landlord was entitled to recover the reasonable value under quasi contractual principles.

**2. Payment by One Person on Behalf of Another (Section 69):**

When a person, without any intention of donating, pays money which another person is bound by law or contract to pay, the person who paid has a right of recovery against the person who should have paid.

*Illustration:* If A is required by law to pay B's taxes but does not, and C pays on behalf of A without intending to donate, C can recover from A.

*Case Law:* In *Exall v. Partridge* (1799), when one bailee paid rent which another bailee should have paid, recovery was allowed under quasi contractual principles.

**3. Non-Gratuitous Act (Section 70):**

When a person acts without intention of donating, but acting in circumstances under which the circumstances show that the person acted for the benefit of another, that other person is liable to compensate for the value of that benefit.

*Illustration:* If A's land is flooded and B, without asking, constructs a dam at considerable expense to save A's land, A is liable to pay B reasonable compensation, even though B acted without express permission.

*Case Law:* In *Åkerhielm v. De Mare* (1959), when a person incurred expenses to preserve another's property, recovery was granted on quasi contractual grounds.

**4. Finder of Goods (Section 71):**

When a person finds goods belonging to another and takes them into possession, the finder is in some respects in the same position as a bailee. The finder may enforce rights and remedies similar to those of a bailee, and may claim reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred.

*Case Law:* In *Nicholson v. Chapman* (1793), a finder of goods was permitted to recover reasonable expenses for preservation of the goods.

**5. Goods Delivered Under Mistake (Section 72):**

When goods are delivered to a person by mistake and that person uses them or deals with them, the person must make restitution or compensate for the value of goods used.

*Illustration:* If goods worth Rs. 5,000 are delivered to A by mistake and A uses them for his business, A must pay Rs. 5,000 (or the value of the benefit received).

#### When Does Quasi Contractual Liability Arise?

**1. Essential Conditions:**

Quasi contractual liability arises when the following conditions are satisfied:

a) **No Valid Contract:** There must be no valid, express contract between the parties that governs the transaction.

b) **Enrichment of Defendant:** The defendant must have been enriched - received a benefit.

c) **Impoverishment of Plaintiff:** The plaintiff must have been impoverished - suffered a loss or detriment.

d) **Connection Between Enrichment and Impoverishment:** There must be a nexus or causal connection between the defendant's enrichment and the plaintiff's impoverishment.

e) **Unjustness:** The enrichment must be unjust - the defendant should not in equity be permitted to retain the benefit.

f) **No Discharge of Obligation:** The obligation must not have been discharged by any other means (e.g., payment, gift).

**2. The Principle of Unjust Enrichment:**

The entire doctrine of quasi contracts rests on the principle that no person should be unjustly enriched at the expense of another. In *Fibrosa Spoleczna Akcyjna v. Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd.* [1943], Lord Wright stated: "The principle of unjust enrichment underlies the whole concept of quasi contracts."

In the Indian context, in *Fatima Begum v. Sri Sailabala Devi* (1950), the Supreme Court recognized the principle of unjust enrichment as the foundation of quasi contractual liability.

**3. Cases Where Quasi Contractual Liability Arises:**

**a) Supply of Necessaries to Incapable Persons:**
As per Section 68, when necessaries are supplied to minors or persons of unsound mind, the supplier can recover reasonable price from that person or their property. In *Warwick v. Bruce* (1813), a tailor who supplied clothes to a minor was entitled to recover reasonable price.

**b) Unsolicited Payment:**
When A pays B's debt without being requested to do so, without intending to donate, and under circumstances showing A acted for B's benefit, A can recover from B. This is governed by Section 69.

**c) Improvement of Property:**
When without intending to donate, a person improves another's property at considerable expense, the owner may be liable to pay reasonable compensation. In *Craven v. White* (1989), this principle was applied in a construction context.

**d) Finder of Lost Goods:**
A finder of goods has quasi contractual rights to recover expenses incurred in preserving or protecting the goods from the true owner. In *South Staffordshire Water Co. v. Sharman* [1896], a finder was entitled to retain goods until compensation for reasonable expenses was paid.

**e) Services Rendered Under Mistake:**
When services are rendered under the mistaken belief that there is a contract or obligation, the service provider may claim restitution under quasi contractual principles.

#### Distinction Between Quasi Contracts and True Contracts

| Aspect | True Contract | Quasi Contract |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Formation | By mutual agreement | By operation of law |
| Essential Elements | Offer, acceptance, consideration, free consent | Enrichment of one party |
| Parties' Intention | Parties intend to be bound | No intention to create obligation |
| Consideration | Must exist | Not required |
| Breach | Contract can be breached | Cannot be breached (no terms to breach) |
| Remedies | Damages for breach | Restitution only |

#### Limitations on Quasi Contractual Recovery

1. **Voluntary Donation:** If A voluntarily donates money to B with intent to gift, no quasi contractual liability arises.

2. **Services Rendered Gratuitously:** If A renders services intending to donate them, B is not liable under quasi contractual principles.

3. **Knowledge of Invalidity:** If A supplies goods to a minor knowing the minor cannot contract, and intends to rely on the minor's obligation despite incapacity, recovery may be denied.

4. **Failure to Demand:** In some contexts, if the party who could have demanded repayment fails to do so, quasi contractual recovery may be barred.

In *Morison v. Glendinning* (1862), it was held that quasi contractual recovery is not available if the plaintiff could have insisted on a formal contract but chose not to do so.

### Conclusion

Quasi contracts are a vital mechanism in law to ensure justice and prevent unjust enrichment. They arise by operation of law in situations where formal contracts do not exist, yet one party has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another. The various types of quasi contracts—supply of necessaries, payment by one on behalf of another, non-gratuitous acts, finder's rights, and delivery under mistake—collectively form a comprehensive framework for equity-based recovery. The essential requirement is that the defendant must have been enriched, the plaintiff impoverished, with a causal nexus between them, and the enrichment must be unjust. While quasi contracts do not rest on mutual agreement like true contracts, they are equally important in achieving justice and preventing parties from retaining benefits they are not entitled to retain in equity and good conscience.
