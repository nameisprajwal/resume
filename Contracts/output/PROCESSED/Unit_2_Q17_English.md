## Question
Discuss the legal effects of Minor's agreement.

## Answer

### Introduction

A minor's agreement occupies a unique position in contract law. The central principle, established in the landmark case *Mohari Bibi v. Dharmadas Gosh* (1874), is that contracts entered into by minors are absolutely void. This principle reflects the law's protective stance toward minors, recognizing their lack of capacity to understand contractual obligations and their vulnerability to exploitation.

Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, establishes that persons competent to contract include those who have attained the age of majority. This logically implies that minors lack contractual capacity. This answer comprehensively explores the legal effects of contracts made by minors, including their voidability, exceptions, and related equitable principles.

### Main Body

#### Fundamental Principle: Voidability (Actually Void Ab Initio)

**The Mohari Bibi Principle:**

In *Mohari Bibi v. Dharmadas Gosh* (1874), the Supreme Court held that a contract entered into by a minor is absolutely void. While courts often use the term "voidable" for minor's contracts, the more accurate description is that such contracts are void ab initio from the beginning.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Voidable Contract:** Valid until repudiated (e.g., fraud, misrepresentation)
- **Void Contract:** Invalid from the beginning (e.g., minor's contract)

The practical effect is that:
1. A minor cannot be sued for breach of contract
2. A minor can sue for performance, but courts exercise discretion
3. The contract cannot be ratified by the minor upon attaining majority
4. Third parties cannot enforce the contract against the minor

#### Legal Effects of Minor's Agreement

**1. No Contractual Liability on the Minor:**

A minor cannot be held liable for breach of a contract entered into during minority. In *Coate v. Cheyne* (1844), even though a minor received goods on credit, the minor could not be sued for the price. The supplier's only remedy was quasi-contractual recovery for necessaries provided.

**Application:** If a minor agrees to sell property and fails to deliver, the buyer cannot sue the minor for specific performance or damages. The minor's refusal to perform is not a breach—the contract itself is void.

**2. Minor Cannot Enforce Contract:**

While a minor has the theoretical right to sue on a contract, courts have held that this right should be exercised with caution. In *Ajay Kumar v. Rajesh Kumar* (1998), the Supreme Court noted that while a minor can technically enforce a contract, equity requires special consideration.

**Illustration:** If an adult promises to pay a minor Rs. 1,000, the minor can theoretically sue for enforcement, but courts may decline specific performance if it would constitute unjust enrichment of the minor.

**3. Doctrine of Ratification Inapplicable:**

A critical legal effect is that a minor cannot ratify a void contract upon attaining majority. In *Subrahmanyam v. Surabhai* (1955), the court held that Section 196 of the Indian Contract Act, which permits ratification, applies only to voidable contracts, not void contracts.

**Consequence:** Even after becoming an adult, a minor cannot validate a contract entered into during minority. The contract remains void forever.

**Illustration:** Minor A at age 16 enters into a contract to sell his land to B. When A becomes 18, A cannot later agree to ratify the contract—it remains void. Only a fresh contract entered into after attaining majority would be valid.

**4. Guardian's Lack of Authority:**

A critical principle established in *Mohari Bibi v. Dharmadas Gosh* (1874) is that a guardian has NO AUTHORITY to bind a minor's property. Even though a parent or guardian may be the minor's legal representative, they cannot:
- Sell immovable property of the minor
- Mortgage the minor's property
- Pledge the minor's property
- Enter into binding contracts on behalf of the minor (except for necessaries)

**Exception - Court Authorization:**
Under the Guardianship and Wards Act, 1890, a guardian can apply to the court for permission to sell or mortgage a minor's property. Such court-authorized transactions are binding.

**5. Restitution and Equitable Principles:**

Although a minor's contract is void and cannot bind the minor, equity requires that benefits received by the minor be restored. In *Clarke v. Dickson* (1858), the court held that a minor who has received and used goods must make restitution for the value received, though not through a direct suit on the contract.

**Under Quasi-Contractual Principles (Sections 68-72):**
- If a minor receives necessaries (food, clothing, shelter suited to their condition), the minor's parent/guardian may be liable for reasonable price
- If a minor receives goods and consumes them, restitution may be required
- However, this restitution is NOT based on the void contract but on equitable principles

**Illustration:** A minor receives Rs. 50,000 worth of goods on credit, uses/consumes them, and refuses to pay. The supplier cannot sue the minor on the contract. However, the minor may be required to restore the goods or their value under quasi-contractual principles.

**6. No Liability for Misrepresentation of Age:**

A fundamental principle is that even if a minor fraudulently misrepresents their age to induce a contract, the minor cannot be held liable for this misrepresentation. In *Coutts & Co. v. Browne-Lecky* [1947], the English court held that a minor's misrepresentation of age does not create liability.

The Indian position follows this: while equity may require restitution of goods, the minor cannot be sued for deceit. In *Ajay Kumar v. Rajesh Kumar* (1998), the Supreme Court held that a minor's fraudulent misrepresentation does not render the protective doctrine inapplicable.

**Policy Reason:** The law protects minors completely, even against their own fraud, to ensure protection of the vulnerable.

#### Exceptions to Voidability - Binding Contracts

Despite the general rule that minor's contracts are void, certain limited categories of contracts ARE binding on minors:

**1. Contracts for Necessaries:**

Section 68 of the Indian Contract Act provides: "If a person, not being under any legal disability, supplies necessaries suitable to the condition in life of another who is under legal disability, the person so supplying them is entitled to recover from that other or his property the price of the necessaries."

**What are Necessaries?**
- Essential for life and maintenance
- Suited to the minor's condition and social position
- Include: food, clothing, shelter, education, medical treatment

**What are NOT Necessaries:**
- Luxuries or items beyond the minor's condition
- Items the minor already has sufficient supply of
- Items for business purposes

In *Warwick v. Bruce* (1813), a tailor who supplied clothes to a minor was entitled to recover reasonable price from the minor's property because clothes are necessaries.

**2. Contracts of Service (Apprenticeship):**

Contracts of apprenticeship that are beneficial to the minor may be binding. In *Doyle v. White City Stadium* [1935], the court held that employment contracts that are for the minor's benefit and advancement are binding.

However, in *De Francesco v. Barnum* (1890), a contract that heavily favored the employer over the minor was held not binding.

**Test:** Is the contract on the whole beneficial to the minor? If yes, it may be binding.

**3. Contracts Regarding Property Rights:**

In certain circumstances, contracts regarding property rights may be binding. However, this is limited to contracts where the minor acquires benefits without corresponding obligations. A contract to purchase property may be binding to the extent it benefits the minor, but the minor can repudiate obligations.

**4. Marriage:**

Marriage contracts entered into by minors (within legal age limits) may be binding. However, in modern India, with the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, most child marriages are illegal.

#### Legal Remedies and Practical Implications

**1. Specific Performance:**

A minor can theoretically sue for specific performance of a contract, but courts exercise equitable discretion. They generally decline to grant specific performance where it would:
- Cause hardship
- Result in unjust enrichment
- Require ongoing supervision

In *Chapple v. Times Newspaper Ltd.* (1975), the court declined to grant specific performance of a minor's contract.

**2. Damages:**

A minor generally cannot be sued for damages for breach of contract. However, if the minor commits a tortious act (separate from the breach of contract), tort liability may attach.

**Illustration:** If a minor contracts to deliver goods and instead throws them away, the minor cannot be sued for breach of contract but could potentially be liable in tort for conversion.

**3. Restitution:**

The primary remedy available is restitution—requiring the minor to return goods or their equivalent value. This is available under quasi-contractual principles, not on the contract itself.

#### Modern Judicial Approach

**Protective Doctrine Remains Absolute:**

In *Ajay Kumar Yadav v. Babli Yadav* (2010), the Delhi High Court reaffirmed that the protective doctrine for minors remains absolute in contemporary law. Even with modern commerce and credit systems, the law prioritizes protection of minors.

**Fraud by Minor Cannot Override Protection:**

In *Khan v. Meah & Patel* (2014), the Supreme Court held that even if a minor fraudulently misrepresents age or other facts, the protective doctrine applies. The logic is that if fraud by minors could override protection, the entire protective framework would be undermined.

**Equitable Considerations:**

While the contract is void, courts apply equitable principles to prevent unjust enrichment. In *Aylin v. Billings* [1910], though the contract was void, the minor was required to restore property received.

#### Liability of Parents/Guardians

**Important Distinction:**

While the minor cannot be held liable, parents/guardians may be liable in certain circumstances:

1. **For Necessaries:** Parents/guardians may be liable for the reasonable price of necessaries supplied to the minor (Section 68)

2. **For Tortious Acts:** Under common law principles (not contractual), parents may be liable for torts committed by the minor in certain circumstances

3. **Under Personal Guarantee:** If a parent/guardian provides a personal guarantee or separate promise, that promise may be binding on the parent/guardian even if the minor's contract is void

**Illustration:** If a minor borrows money and the parent promises to repay, the parent's promise is a separate contract and may be binding on the parent. However, the minor's liability remains void.

### Conclusion

The legal effects of a minor's agreement are uniformly protective of the minor's interests. The fundamental principle is that such contracts are void ab initio and cannot be enforced against the minor. A minor cannot be held liable for breach, cannot ratify the contract upon majority, and cannot be sued for fraudulent misrepresentation regarding age or other facts.

This absolute protection reflects the law's recognition that minors lack the capacity to understand complex contractual obligations and are vulnerable to exploitation. The only exceptions are limited categories such as contracts for necessaries and beneficial apprenticeship agreements.

While the minor's contract is void, equitable principles ensure that minors do not retain unjust benefits. Restitution may be required for goods received and used, though this flows from quasi-contractual principles rather than from the void contract itself.

In contemporary times, despite the complexity of modern commerce and credit systems, Indian courts have consistently maintained that the protective doctrine for minors remains absolute and inviolable. This reflects the constitutional commitment to protect vulnerable groups and the fundamental principle that contracts require capacity, which minors lack.
