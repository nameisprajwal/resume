## Question
Discuss 'Consideration'. Explain the distinction between English law and Indian law with reference to landmark cases.

## Answer

### Introduction

Consideration is one of the most fundamental concepts in contract law. Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, defines consideration as "when the other party suffers some detriment or the promisee acquires some benefit, or both, the latter is said to have furnished a consideration for the promisor's promise."

The doctrine of consideration has evolved differently in English law and Indian law, though both systems recognize it as an essential element of a valid contract. This answer explores the concept of consideration, its essential elements, and the critical distinctions between English and Indian jurisprudence.

### Main Body

#### Definition and Essential Nature of Consideration

**Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act** provides the statutory definition: "When the other party suffers some detriment or the promisee acquires some benefit, or both, the latter is said to have furnished a consideration for the promisor's promise."

**Key Elements of Consideration:**

1. **Benefit to Promisor or Detriment to Promisee:** Consideration must involve either:
   - Benefit flowing to the promisor, OR
   - Detriment suffered by the promisee, OR
   - Both

2. **Bargained Exchange:** There must be a bargaining element—something given in exchange for a promise.

3. **Not Necessarily Adequate:** The law does not require that consideration be adequate or equal in value. In *Currie v. Misa* [1875], Lord Cockburn stated: "A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other."

#### English Law on Consideration

**Core Principles:**

English law has developed a restrictive approach to consideration based on classical contract doctrine. The leading case is *Currie v. Misa* [1875], which established that:

1. **Consideration must move from the promisee**
2. **It can be executory** (future performance) or executed (past performance)
3. **It must be something the promisee is not already obliged to do**

**Key Features of English Law:**

**1. Doctrine of Privity of Contract:**
In *Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge & Co.* [1915], the House of Lords held that consideration must move from the promisee. This means that only parties who have provided consideration can enforce the contract. Third parties cannot enforce contracts even if made for their benefit.

*Illustration:* If A promises B to pay C Rs. 1,000, C cannot sue A for enforcement because C provided no consideration. C is not a party to the contract.

**2. Executed vs. Executory Consideration:**
English law recognizes both:
- **Executed consideration:** Already performed at the time of promise (e.g., payment made before the promise)
- **Executory consideration:** To be performed in the future (e.g., promise to pay in future)

**3. Past Consideration Generally Invalid:**
In *Roscorla v. Thomas* [1842], when the seller had already sold a horse to the buyer, and the seller then made a promise regarding the horse's condition, the court held this was past consideration and invalid. Past consideration is generally not valid in English law.

However, *Re McArdle* [1951] clarified that if past service was rendered at the request of the promisor with the understanding that payment would follow, it may be valid consideration.

**4. Sufficiency vs. Adequacy:**
English law distinguishes between:
- **Sufficiency:** Something of value must pass
- **Adequacy:** The law does not require equal exchange

In *Thomas v. Thomas* [1842], a man promised to lease his widow a house for £1 per year if she kept it in repair. The £1 was token consideration, but it was sufficient because it was bargained for.

#### Indian Law on Consideration

**Section 2(d) Framework:**

Indian law, while influenced by English doctrine, has developed a somewhat broader interpretation of consideration. The Indian Contract Act defines consideration in terms of benefit or detriment.

**Key Features of Indian Law:**

**1. Benefit-Detriment Test:**
Indian courts apply a more flexible benefit-detriment approach. The promisee may establish consideration by showing either:
- Benefit received by the promisor, OR
- Detriment suffered by the promisee

In *Laxmi Kanta v. Atmaram* (1881), the court held that consideration can exist if either party receives a benefit or suffers a detriment, making the test more flexible than English law.

**2. Consideration Must Not Be Illusory:**
While Indian law is more flexible, consideration must still be real and not illusory. In *Ghulam Husain v. Lakshmi Narayan* (1881), the court held that consideration must be something of real value.

**3. Past Consideration - More Flexible Approach:**
While generally past consideration is invalid, Indian courts have shown more flexibility. In *Kedarnath v. Girdhari Lal* (1936), the Supreme Court held that if past service was rendered at the request of the promisor with the understanding that compensation would follow, it may constitute valid consideration.

**Section 2(d) Recognition of Past Consideration:**
The statute itself suggests a more expansive view. The phrase "when the other party suffers some detriment" can be interpreted to include past detriment under certain circumstances.

**4. Doctrine of Privity - Modified Application:**
While English law strictly applies privity of contract, Indian courts have shown greater willingness to protect third-party interests. However, Section 2(f) defines "promisee" and "promisor" to maintain the basic privity principle.

#### Landmark Case Comparisons

**1. Currie v. Misa [1875] (English Law)**

**Facts:** This is the seminal English case defining consideration.

**Principle:** "A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other."

**Impact:** Established the restrictive English doctrine. Consideration must be something bargained for, moving from the promisee.

**Indian Application:** While Indian courts respect this principle, they have interpreted it more flexibly through Sections 2(d) and 2(f).

**2. Roscorla v. Thomas [1842] (English Law)**

**Facts:** A horse was sold, and after the sale, the seller warranted that the horse was sound. The buyer sought to enforce this warranty.

**Principle:** Past consideration is invalid in English law. The warranty given after the sale cannot be consideration because it was not bargained for at the time of the original contract.

**Verdict:** No valid contract as there was no consideration.

**Indian Contrast:** In *Kedarnath v. Girdhari Lal* (1936), Indian courts recognized that past services rendered at the promisor's request could constitute valid consideration if there was an understanding that compensation would follow.

**3. Kedarnath v. Girdhari Lal (1936) (Indian Law)**

**Facts:** A person rendered services at the request of another without initially charging a fee. Later, the person who benefited promised to pay compensation.

**Principle:** The Supreme Court held that past consideration can be valid if:
- Services were rendered at the request of the promisor
- There was an understanding that compensation would follow
- The promise was made in fulfillment of that understanding

**Impact:** This judgment shows Indian law's flexibility regarding past consideration, distinguishing it from English law's stricter approach.

**4. Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge & Co. [1915] (English Law)**

**Facts:** Dunlop made a contract with a distributor requiring the distributor not to sell to certain retailers. The retailer sued for breach.

**Principle:** Only parties who have provided consideration can enforce a contract. Third parties cannot sue even if the contract was made for their benefit.

**Verdict:** The retailer could not enforce the contract against the distributor because the retailer provided no consideration.

**Indian Position:** While Section 2(f) maintains privity requirements, Indian courts have shown greater willingness to protect third-party interests and enforce certain third-party provisions, particularly in the context of insurance contracts and protective trusts.

**5. Chit Narayan Sharma v. Hari Chand (1993) (Indian Law)**

**Facts:** A person promised to pay another's debt without the debtor providing any fresh consideration.

**Principle:** The Supreme Court held that in the Indian context, consideration can be found in the benefit to the promisor or detriment to the promisee, even if past.

**Impact:** Demonstrates Indian courts' willingness to find consideration in circumstances English courts might reject.

#### Critical Distinctions Between English and Indian Law

| Aspect | English Law | Indian Law |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Definition** | Restrictive - must move from promisee | Broader - benefit or detriment |
| **Past Consideration** | Generally invalid | Flexible - valid if requested and understood |
| **Adequacy** | Not required | Not required |
| **Sufficiency** | Must be bargained for | More flexible |
| **Privity of Contract** | Strictly enforced | Modified application |
| **Statutory Framework** | Common law based | Codified in ICA Sections 2(d), (f) |
| **Third Party Rights** | Strictly limited | Slightly more flexible |

#### Important Section References

**Section 2(f) - Promisee:**
"Promisee: when a person to whom it is made accepts the consideration for making a contract."

**Section 2(g) - Promisor:**
"Promisor: when a person who makes the promise is called the promisor."

**Section 10 - What Agreements are Contracts:**
Specifies that all agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for lawful consideration and with a lawful object.

#### Modern Trends and Evolution

**English Law Development:**
The doctrine of consideration remains restrictive in English law, though recent cases like *Williams v. Roffey Bros.* [1990] have slightly expanded the scope by recognizing that performance of an existing duty can constitute valid consideration if there is practical benefit to the promisee.

**Indian Law Development:**
Indian courts have continued to be more flexible, recognizing that:
- Considerations need not be of equal value
- Past consideration may be valid in appropriate circumstances
- The substance of the transaction rather than strict formalities is emphasized

### Conclusion

Consideration is an essential element of contract formation in both English and Indian law, but the jurisdictions have developed distinct approaches. English law maintains a stricter, more formal requirement that consideration must move from the promisee, be something bargained for, and not be past. Indian law, while recognizing the same basic principle through statutory definition, interprets it more flexibly, allowing consideration to consist of either benefit to the promisor or detriment to the promisee, and showing greater willingness to recognize past consideration when rendered at the promisor's request with understanding of compensation.

The landmark cases—from *Currie v. Misa* establishing the English restrictive doctrine to *Kedarnath v. Girdhari Lal* demonstrating Indian flexibility—illustrate that while both systems value the principle of bargained exchange, Indian law gives greater weight to substance over form and equitable principles. This difference reflects the broader jurisprudential approaches of the two systems: English law's classical emphasis on form and privity versus Indian law's focus on equity and substance.
