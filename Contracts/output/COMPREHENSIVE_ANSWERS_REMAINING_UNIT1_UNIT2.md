# UNIT I – REMAINING FORMATION QUESTIONS

## Unit I, Question 4
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Case Study

### Question
A sells a car worth Rs. 10,000 to B for Rs. 5,000. Both A and B knew the car's market value. B refuses to pay. Discuss whether A can enforce the contract.

### Answer

**Legal Position:** A can enforce the contract. The contract is valid and enforceable despite disparity in consideration.

**Principle:** Courts do not investigate adequacy of consideration—only its presence. In *Chappell & Co. Ltd. v. Nestlé Co. Ltd.* [1960], the court held that consideration need not be adequate or proportionate to the promise given. If the parties freely agreed, consideration exists.

**Application to Facts:**
- A (seller) promises to transfer car
- B (buyer) promises to pay Rs. 5,000
- This is valid consideration—B gives money, A gives car
- Market value disparity irrelevant if both parties voluntarily agreed

**Key Authority:** In *Currie v. Misa* (1875), consideration was defined as benefit to promisor or detriment to promisee—not as equivalent value.

**Conclusion:** A can enforce contract and claim specific performance or damages for non-payment. The fact that B "got a good deal" does not vitiate the contract.

## Unit I, Question 5
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
Explain the different modes of termination of an offer.

### Answer

**Modes of Termination:**

**1. Acceptance:** Offer terminates when accepted—creating binding contract.

**2. Rejection:** Express or implied rejection by offeree terminates offer. In *Hyde v. Wrench* (1840), counter-offer constituted rejection.

**3. Lapse of Time:** If offeror specifies time, offer lapses after that period. If no time specified, offer lapses after reasonable time (depends on nature of transaction).

**Case:** In *Ramsgate Hotel Co. v. Montefiore* (1866), offer for shares lapsed after 5 months despite no express time limit—period was unreasonable in context.

**4. Revocation:** Offeror can revoke offer anytime before acceptance. In *Payne v. Cave* (1789), auction bid could be revoked before hammer fell.

**Limitation:** Cannot revoke if offer is already accepted or if consideration has been paid for keeping offer open (option contract).

**5. Death or Insanity:** If offeror dies/becomes insane, offer terminates (in most jurisdictions).

**6. Illegality:** If act contemplated becomes illegal, offer terminates.

**Example:** Offer to sell prohibited goods becomes illegal if law changes.

## Unit I, Question 6
**Marks:** 10

### Question
Discuss the legal effect of invitation to treat. Distinguish it from offer with case law.

### Answer

### Introduction

An invitation to treat is an invitation to make an offer, not itself an offer. The distinction between "invitation to treat" and "offer" is fundamental in contract law, determining when a binding contract is formed and who has the power to accept or reject.

### Main Body

#### Definition of Invitation to Treat

An invitation to treat is a communication inviting the other party to make an offer. It is preliminary to contract formation—the party making the invitation has not yet proposed binding terms.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Offer:** Proposal of binding terms; offeree has power to accept and create contract
- **Invitation to Treat:** Invitation for others to make offers; invitor can accept or reject offers

#### Legal Consequences of Classification

**If Classified as Offer:**
- Other party can accept and create binding contract
- Cannot be withdrawn without liability
- Party making it must be bound if accepted

**If Classified as Invitation to Treat:**
- Party making it CAN withdraw anytime
- Other party must make offer (which can be rejected)
- NO binding contract until party making invitation accepts the offer

#### Classic Case: Pharmaceutical Society v. Boots [1952]

**Facts:** Boots displayed medicines on shelves with price tags. Customer selected medicine and took to checkout. Boots refused sale (medicine was controlled substance).

**Court's Holding:** Display of goods in shop is invitation to treat, NOT offer.

**Reasoning:** 
- Store invites customers to make offers
- Customer's act of selecting and bringing to checkout is offer
- Cashier's acceptance at checkout creates contract
- Store can refuse sale of any item

**Significance:** Store cannot be forced to sell displayed goods; has discretion to accept or reject.

#### Application to Different Situations

**1. Display of Goods in Shops:**

In *Pharmaceutical Society v. Boots* [1952], display of goods is invitation to treat.

**Consequence:** Shopkeeper can refuse service (with some legal exceptions—non-discrimination laws).

**2. Advertisements:**

In *Partridge v. Crittenden* (1968), an advertisement in newspaper offering birds for sale was invitation to treat, not offer.

**Principle:** Advertisements are invitations to treat because advertiser doesn't intend to be bound by each inquiry.

**Exception:** If advertisement is unusually specific and indicates intention to be bound, it may be offer.

**Case:** In *Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.* [1893], company's advertisement was offer because of:
- Specificity of terms
- Promise of £100 deposit to show sincerity
- Clear intention to be bound

**3. Auction Sales:**

In *Harris v. Nickerson* (1873), announcement of auction is invitation to treat.

- Auctioneer invites bids
- Bid is offer
- Fall of hammer = acceptance by auctioneer

**Consequence:** Auctioneer can withdraw auction anytime before sale.

**4. Tender Invitations:**

Government/Company invitation to submit tenders is invitation to treat.

- Tenderer makes offer by submitting tender
- Government/Company can accept or reject

**Case:** In *Spencer v. Harding* (1870), invitation to tender is not offer—tenderer's submission is offer.

**5. Price Lists:**

Distribution of catalogues, price lists, rate cards = invitation to treat.

- Seller invites customer to make offer at prices listed
- Seller can refuse orders at listed prices (with limitations)

#### Burden of Proof

**Who determines classification?**

Courts examine:
1. Words used in communication
2. Conduct of parties
3. Context and trade practice
4. Intent of parties (what reasonable person would understand)

**Case:** In *Scammell v. Ouston* [1941], parties' negotiations were analyzed to determine whether final communication was offer or invitation to treat.

#### Exceptions and Limitations

**1. Statutory Exceptions:**

Consumer protection laws (Sale of Goods Act, Consumer Protection Act) may override:
- Non-refusal rights
- Enforced acceptance at advertised prices
- Discrimination prevention

**2. Estoppel:**

If party makes representation that something is offer and other party relies, party may be estopped from claiming it's invitation to treat.

**3. Specific Commitments:**

If communication includes specific commitment to supply at certain price to certain quantity, it may be offer despite format.

#### Practical Significance

**Why This Distinction Matters:**

1. **Determines Contract Formation:** When is contract actually formed?

2. **Determines Party's Discretion:** Can seller refuse to sell?

3. **Determines Liability:** Who can be sued for breach?

4. **Determines Remedies:** What damages are available?

**Illustration:** 

Scenario: Store displays laptop at Rs. 50,000 with sign "Limited Stock Available."

- If display = invitation to treat: Store can refuse sale to anyone (or limit to first 5 customers)
- If display = offer: Store must sell to anyone who presents laptop at checkout (unless stock exhausted)

#### Modern Digital Context

In online shopping:
- Display of products on website = invitation to treat
- Customer's selection = offer
- Website's confirmation = acceptance
- This allows e-commerce platforms to manage inventory and refuse orders

**Case:** In *Hill v. Gateway 2000 Inc.* [1997], terms inside computer package formed contract because packaging itself was invitation to treat, acceptance occurred on opening.

### Conclusion

The distinction between invitation to treat and offer fundamentally shapes contract law. Invitations to treat are communications inviting others to make offers—the party making the invitation retains discretion to accept or reject. Offers, conversely, are binding proposals that create contracts upon acceptance.

Courts apply pragmatic analysis examining words, context, and parties' intent to classify communications. The distinction has profound practical significance, determining when contracts form, who has discretion, and what remedies are available. Modern commerce depends on this distinction—retailers displaying goods make invitations to treat, giving them discretion to manage inventory and refuse transactions, while customer selections constitute offers that retailers can accept or reject.

## Unit I, Question 7
**Marks:** 10

### Question
Explain the modes of acceptance of an offer. What constitutes valid acceptance?

### Answer

### Introduction

Acceptance is the final and definitive expression of the offeree's assent to all terms of the offer. Section 2(b) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, defines acceptance as "when the person to whom the offer is made signifies his assent thereto."

Acceptance transforms an offer into a binding contract. This answer explores the modes of acceptance, requirements for valid acceptance, and the timing of acceptance's effect.

### Main Body

#### Definition of Valid Acceptance

**Section 2(b) ICA:** Acceptance is signification of assent by offeree to offer.

**Requirements for Valid Acceptance:**
1. Must be unconditional assent to ALL terms
2. Must be communicated to offeror
3. Must be given before offer lapses
4. Must follow prescribed mode (if specified)

#### Modes of Acceptance

**1. Express Acceptance:**

Explicit communication of assent through words (spoken or written).

**Examples:**
- "I accept your offer"
- Signing contract
- Verbal confirmation
- Written email/letter accepting terms

**Case:** In *Entores Ltd. v. Miles Far Eastern Corporation* [1955], acceptance by telegram constituted valid acceptance despite not being face-to-face.

**2. Implied Acceptance:**

Conduct of offeree indicates assent without explicit words.

**Examples:**
- Offeree begins performance of contract
- Offeree pays money as acceptance of sale
- Conduct consistent with accepting terms

**Case:** In *Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.* [1893], using the smoke ball as specified was valid acceptance of the offer despite not saying "I accept."

**3. Acceptance by Conduct:**

Actions of offeree demonstrating assent.

**Illustration:** Offeror offers to sell house; offeree enters into possession and begins paying installments = acceptance by conduct.

**Case:** In *Upton-on-Severn RDC v. Powell* [1942], taking possession of premises constituted acceptance of tenancy offer.

#### Conditions for Valid Acceptance

**1. Unconditional:**

Acceptance must be unconditional—unconditional assent to EXACT terms offered, not modified terms.

**Conditional Acceptance = Counter-Offer:**

If offeree's acceptance includes conditions or modifications, it's counter-offer, not acceptance.

**Case:** In *Hyde v. Wrench* (1840), "I accept but at Rs. 60 instead of Rs. 100" was counter-offer, not acceptance. Counter-offer rejected original offer.

**2. Must Accept ALL Terms:**

Offeree cannot cherry-pick—must accept all material terms of offer.

**3. Must Be Clear and Unambiguous:**

Acceptance must clearly manifest assent, not leave room for doubt.

**Case:** In *Scammell v. Ouston* [1941], vague acceptance with undefined terms was not valid acceptance.

**4. Must Follow Prescribed Mode (if any):**

If offeror specifies mode of acceptance, offeree must follow that mode.

**Section 7 ICA:** Acceptance must be expressed at time and place offered, or acceptance at other time/place constitutes counter-offer.

**Illustration:** Offer states "Accept only by registered letter." Email acceptance would not be valid.

**Exception:** If prescribed mode cannot be followed, any reasonable mode suffices. In *Manchester Diocesan Council for Education v. Commercial and General Investments Ltd.* [1970], when prescribed mode proved impossible, acceptance by reasonable alternative was valid.

#### Communication of Acceptance

**Essential Requirement:** Acceptance must be COMMUNICATED to offeror.

**Mere Mental Assent Insufficient:** Offeree's internal decision to accept, not communicated, does not create contract.

**Case:** In *Felthouse v. Bindley* (1862), offeror's uncle offered to buy horse at price. Nephew thought of price as reasonable but didn't communicate acceptance. No contract formed—acceptance not communicated.

**Methods of Communication:**
- Verbal statement
- Written letter/email
- Conduct demonstrating acceptance
- Actions constituting acceptance (as in Carlill case)

**Acceptance by Silence:**

General Rule: Silence does not constitute acceptance.

**Rationale:** Cannot bind offeror to contract without their knowledge.

**Exceptions:**
- If parties have prior dealings establishing that silence = acceptance
- If accepted practice in trade
- If offeree accepts benefits with knowledge they're offered as consideration for acceptance

**Case:** In *Felthouse v. Bindley* (1862), even unopposed silence didn't constitute acceptance absent prior course of dealing.

#### Timing of Acceptance

**1. Before Offer Lapses:**

Acceptance must occur while offer is still open (before expiration of specified or reasonable time).

**Case:** In *Ramsgate Hotel Co. v. Montefiore* (1866), acceptance came too late—offer had lapsed due to passage of time.

**2. Valid at Time of Communication:**

Acceptance becomes effective when communicated.

**Section 4 ICA:** Acceptance is complete "when the person accepting the offer puts his acceptance in course of transmission to the person making the offer."

**3. Postal Acceptance:**

Special rule for postal acceptance (derived from common law):

- Acceptance by post is effective when letter is POSTED, not when received
- Applies only if post is reasonable mode and not expressly excluded
- Offeror cannot revoke after acceptance posted
- Risk of loss/delay falls on offeror

**Case:** In *Adams v. Lindsell* (1818), acceptance by post was effective upon posting, even though letter was delayed.

**Rationale:** Without this rule, offeree risks offer being revoked while letter in transit.

**Modern Context:** Does postal rule apply to emails?

- Courts generally hold email acceptance effective upon sending (not receipt)
- But if email goes to spam, question arises whether it was "communicated"

#### Cross-Offer Problem

**Definition:** Two parties make similar offers to each other simultaneously, neither knowing of the other's offer.

**Legal Position:** No contract forms. Each party made offer to other, not accepting other's offer.

**Case:** In *Tinn v. Hoffmann & Co.* (1873), simultaneous cross-offers didn't form contract.

#### Acceptance After Offer Revoked

**Rule:** Acceptance of revoked offer is ineffective—no contract forms.

**Timing:** 

- **Postal Rule Exception:** If acceptance posted before offer revoked, acceptance is valid
- **Revocation effective** when received by offeree, not when sent

**Case:** In *Byrne v. Van Tienhoven* (1880), revocation sent by mail didn't take effect before acceptance was posted. Contract formed despite revocation in mail.

#### Battle of Forms

**Scenario:** Offeror sends terms; offeree accepts but includes different terms.

**Legal Position:** Is offeree's response acceptance or counter-offer?

**Rule (Section 7):** Unconditional assent to offer = acceptance. Modified terms = counter-offer.

**Case:** In *Butler Machine Tool Co. Ltd. v. Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd.* [1979], offeree's acceptance with different terms was counter-offer, not acceptance.

#### Conditional Acceptance

**Illusory Acceptance:** Acceptance subject to condition = not valid acceptance.

**Example:** "I accept if you also do X" = conditional acceptance = counter-offer.

**Valid Acceptance:** Unconditional acceptance, even if circumstances unusual or offeree faces hardship.

### Conclusion

Valid acceptance requires unconditional, clear communication of assent to all terms of offer, communicated before offer lapses. Acceptance can be express, implied, or by conduct, but must be clearly manifested so offeror knows acceptance has occurred.

The postal rule provides important protection for offerees—acceptance by post is effective upon posting, not receipt, allowing offerees certainty that acceptance is effective despite mail delays. Modern commerce increasingly uses electronic means—courts extending similar principles to emails and electronic communications.

Acceptance transforms offer into binding contract. Understanding valid modes of acceptance is essential to determining when contracts form and protecting parties' rights.

## Unit I, Question 8
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What is meant by 'Offer'? State the essential elements of a valid offer.

### Answer

**Definition:** An offer is a proposal for entering into a contract—proposal of definite terms which, if accepted without qualification, creates binding contract.

**Essential Elements:**

**1. Definite Terms:**
- All material terms must be specified
- Price, quantity, time of delivery must be clear
- Terms must not be left to future negotiation

**Case:** In *Scammell v. Ouston* [1941], undefined terms made communication not an offer.

**2. Intention to be Bound:**
- Offeror must intend to be legally bound if accepted
- Not mere expression of opinion or statement of willingness to negotiate

**3. Communication:**
- Offer must be communicated to offeree
- Mental intention alone insufficient

**4. Specificity of Condition:**
- If acceptance requires specific act, that act must be clearly defined

**5. Unconditional Nature:**
- Offer must not be conditioned on events not in parties' control

**Examples of Valid Offers:**
- "I sell my car for Rs. 2,00,000"
- "Deliver goods by 15th December at Rs. 50 per unit"

**NOT Valid Offers:**
- Shop window display (invitation to treat)
- Advertisement (generally)
- Statement of intention to negotiate

## Unit I, Question 9
**Marks:** 10

### Question
Discuss the doctrine of consideration. What constitutes valid consideration?

### Answer

### Introduction

Consideration is the essential element in contract formation—it is the exchange of value between parties. Section 2(d) ICA defines consideration as something of value given by one party in exchange for a promise from the other.

Without consideration, a promise is generally not enforceable as contract. This answer explores what constitutes valid consideration, its necessity, and exceptions.

### Main Body

#### Definition of Consideration

**Section 2(d) ICA:** "When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise."

**Simple Definition:** Consideration is something of value—either doing something, refraining from doing something, or promising to do or refrain from doing something.

**Key Principle:** Consideration must move from promisee—but need not benefit promisor.

#### Essential Characteristics of Valid Consideration

**1. Must be Real:**

Consideration must be something of real value—courts don't inquire into adequacy of consideration.

**Case:** In *Currie v. Misa* (1875), consideration was defined as benefit to promisor or detriment to promisee.

**Adequacy NOT Required:** Rs. 1 for Rs. 1,000 is valid consideration if both parties freely agree.

**Case:** In *Chappell & Co. v. Nestlé Co.* [1960], wrapper from chocolate bar was valid consideration (though worth pennies) because parties so agreed.

**2. Must Move from Promisee:**

Consideration must come from party to whom promise is made, or party identified as promisee.

**Exception - Third-Party Consideration:** In Indian law, consideration can be furnished by third party (rule differs from English law).

**Case:** In *Kedarnath v. Girdhari Lal* (1947), Supreme Court held that consideration moving from third party sufficient in Indian law.

**3. Must be Given at Desire of Promisor:**

Consideration must be furnished because promisor desired/requested it.

**Illustration:** A does act because B asked, and B promises payment for that act. A's act = consideration.

**NOT Consideration:** A does act for own reasons; B later promises to pay. B's promise lacks consideration because not in response to A's act (gratuitous promise).

**Case:** In *Roscorla v. Thomas* (1842), promise made after act (for which no consideration sought) is unsupported by consideration—it's gratuitous promise.

**4. Must be Legal:**

Consideration must not violate law or public policy.

**Illustration:** Promise to pay for unlawful act is not enforceable—illegal consideration.

**Section 23 ICA:** Agreements with illegal consideration are void.

**5. Must Exist:**

Consideration must exist at time contract is formed.

**Future Consideration:** Both past and existing consideration acceptable, but consideration must exist.

**6. Must be Certain:**

Consideration must be capable of being determined with certainty.

**Vague Consideration:** If what constitutes consideration is unclear, may not be enforceable.

#### Types of Consideration

**1. Positive Consideration:**

Doing something—affirmative act.

**Illustration:** A promises to pay Rs. 100; B promises to deliver goods.

**2. Negative Consideration:**

Refraining from doing something—forbearance.

**Illustration:** A promises to pay Rs. 10,000 if B refrains from pursuing legal claim against A.

**Valid Consideration:** B's forbearance from legal action is consideration.

**3. Executory Consideration:**

Promise of future performance.

**Illustration:** "I promise to pay tomorrow if you promise to deliver goods tomorrow."

Both promises are executory—constituted when contracts made, performed later.

**4. Executed Consideration:**

Performance already completed before contract.

**Illustration:** A asks B to paint his house. B paints house. A later promises to pay Rs. 5,000.

**Problem:** B's painting done BEFORE A's promise. Is this consideration?

**General Rule:** Past consideration insufficient (not consideration at all).

**Exception:** If circumstances show A implicitly requested B to perform with understanding A would pay later, past act may constitute consideration.

**Case:** In *Kedarnath Banerjee v. Girdhari Lal* (1947), consideration moving from third party after contract (past consideration) upheld by Supreme Court in specific circumstances.

#### Distinction from Motive

**Motive:** Reason why party enters contract.

**Consideration:** What is actually exchanged.

**Example:** A promises to donate Rs. 1,00,000 to charity with no consideration. Charity's gratitude is motive, not consideration.

**Principle:** Gratuitous promises lack consideration and are not enforceable contracts.

#### No Consideration - Exceptions

**Certain situations don't require consideration:**

**1. Sealed Contracts:**

If contract is sealed (with proper sealing formality), consideration not required.

**Indian Context:** Not common in modern law.

**2. Estoppel:**

If party makes representation and other party relies, may be estopped from claiming lack of consideration.

**3. Statutory Exceptions:**

Some statutes make promises enforceable without consideration (e.g., written promises, charitable subscriptions in some jurisdictions).

#### Consideration in Indian vs. English Law

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | English Law | Indian Law |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Third-Party Consideration** | Not sufficient | Sufficient (Kedarnath principle) |
| **Adequacy** | Courts don't inquire | Courts don't inquire |
| **Past Consideration** | Never sufficient | Possibly sufficient in circumstances |
| **Privity** | Strict privity rule | More flexible approach |

#### Practical Significance

**Why Consideration Matters:**

1. **Enforceability:** Distinguishes contracts (enforceable) from gratuitous promises (generally not enforceable)

2. **Intent to be Bound:** Presence of consideration suggests parties intended binding contract

3. **Fairness:** Ensures both parties exchange value—prevents one-sided exploitation

**Illustration:** 

A promises to gift house to B. Later A reneges. Can B sue?

- If gratuitous gift (no consideration): B cannot sue—no enforceable contract
- If A promised in exchange for B's service/payment: B can sue—valid consideration exists

### Conclusion

Consideration is the cornerstone of contract law—it distinguishes enforceable contracts from gratuitous promises. Valid consideration must be real, legal, moving from promisee, given at promisor's desire, and certain.

Remarkably, courts do not inquire into adequacy of consideration—Rs. 1 for Rs. 1,000 is valid if parties freely agree. This protects freedom to contract while ensuring enforceability through the exchange mechanism.

Modern contract law recognizes consideration in varied forms—money, goods, services, or even forbearance from legal rights. Understanding consideration is essential to determining when binding contracts form and what remedies are available when promises are broken.

## Unit I, Question 10
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
Explain the concept of 'Privity of Contract'. What are its implications?

### Answer

**Definition:** Privity of contract means only parties to a contract can sue or be sued on that contract. Third parties cannot enforce or be bound by the contract.

**Principle:** Contract binds only those who are parties to it—gives rights and liabilities only to parties.

**English Law Position:** Strict privity doctrine—third parties have no rights.

**Indian Law Position:** More flexible—exceptions recognized where:
- Third party is beneficiary
- Statute provides otherwise
- Trust is created for third party

**Key Implications:**

**1. Third Parties Cannot Sue:**
If A contracts with B to provide services to C, C cannot sue A for breach even though C is ultimate beneficiary.

**Case:** In *Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. Selfridge & Co. Ltd.* [1915], retailer's customer could not sue tyre manufacturer—no privity.

**2. Third Parties Not Bound:**
Third parties cannot be forced to perform obligations under contract.

**3. Exception - Beneficiaries:**
If contract clearly intends to benefit third party, exceptions apply.

**Case:** In *Tweddle v. Atkinson* (1861), third-party beneficiary could not sue despite clear intent to benefit them.

**4. Modern Exceptions:**
- Trusts for third parties
- Insurance policies
- Statutory provisions (Sale of Goods Act provides some third-party protections)

**Conclusion:** Privity remains fundamental—only parties to contract have rights/liabilities, subject to statutory and equitable exceptions.

## Unit I, Question 11
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Case Study

### Question
A offers to sell goods to B at Rs. 100 per unit for 1,000 units, delivery in 30 days. B says "I accept but will pay only Rs. 90 per unit." What is the legal status? Can A enforce?

### Answer

**Legal Status:** B's response is COUNTER-OFFER, NOT acceptance of A's offer.

**Reasoning:**

B's response is conditional acceptance—B has modified essential term (price). Modified acceptance = counter-offer, not acceptance.

**Case Authority:** In *Hyde v. Wrench* (1840), modified acceptance was held to be counter-offer, rejecting original offer.

**Consequence:**

1. **A's Original Offer:** Terminated and cannot be accepted now
2. **B's Counter-Offer:** Now constitutes new offer to A (at Rs. 90)
3. **Contract Formation:** Will occur only if A accepts B's counter-offer at Rs. 90

**Can A Enforce?** 

NO—A cannot enforce against B because:
- B never accepted A's offer
- B's counter-offer doesn't create contract unless A accepts it
- If A refuses to accept counter-offer, no contract exists

**A's Options:**

1. Accept B's counter-offer at Rs. 90 (creates binding contract)
2. Reject B's counter-offer and make new offer to B
3. Do nothing—transaction fails

**Practical Application:**

This principle commonly arises in:
- Purchase orders with changed terms
- Negotiations where one party modifies key terms
- Battle of forms in commercial transactions

**Conclusion:** B's modified response is counter-offer, not acceptance. A cannot force contract at Rs. 100—only has choices to accept Rs. 90 or negotiate further.

## Unit I, Question 12
**Marks:** 10

### Question
Discuss the doctrine of free consent. What vitiates free consent?

### Answer

### Introduction

Free consent is essential to valid contracts. Section 13 ICA defines "free consent" and Section 14-21 enumerates circumstances that vitiate free consent: coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, and mistake.

A contract lacking free consent is voidable—valid until repudiated by party whose consent was not free. This answer explores the doctrine and vitiating factors.

### Main Body

#### Definition of Free Consent

**Section 13 ICA:** "Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense."

**Section 14 ICA:** "Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by:
(1) Coercion
(2) Undue influence
(3) Fraud
(4) Misrepresentation
(5) Mistake"

**Essence:** Free consent means parties voluntarily agree, with full understanding, without improper pressure or deception.

#### Vitiating Factors - Overview

**1. Coercion (Section 15)**

**Definition:** Committing or threatening to commit act unlawful or causing detrimental harm.

**Elements:**
- Act must be unlawful or create fear of harm
- Act must be threatened/done with intent to obtain consent
- Consent obtained through coercion

**Case:** In *Barton v. Armstrong* [1976], threat of violence constituted coercion.

**Consequence:** Contract is voidable—coerced party can rescind.

**Illustration:** "Sign this contract or I'll break your legs" = coercion. Contract voidable.

**2. Undue Influence (Section 15-16)**

Covered extensively in Q18 answer above.

**Brief:** Exercise of mental/moral dominance preventing independent will.

**Presumed in certain relationships:** Parent-child, doctor-patient, lawyer-client, spiritual guide-follower.

**Consequence:** Voidable contract. Party influenced can rescind and restore benefits.

**3. Fraud (Section 17)**

Covered extensively in Q14 answer above.

**Brief:** Active misrepresentation, concealment, or false statement knowingly made to deceive.

**Five Elements:**
- False representation
- Knowledge of falsity
- Intent to induce reliance
- Reliance by other party
- Resulting injury

**Consequence:** Voidable contract. Defrauded party can rescind or claim damages.

**Case:** In *Peek v. Gurney* (1873), fraud requires active misrepresentation, not mere non-disclosure.

**4. Misrepresentation (Section 18)**

**Definition:** Untrue statement of material fact inducing contract, but without fraudulent intent.

**Difference from Fraud:**
- Fraud requires knowledge of falsity + intent to deceive
- Misrepresentation is innocent—party doesn't know statement is false

**Consequence:** Voidable contract. Misled party can rescind but cannot claim damages (unless fraud proven separately).

**Case:** In *Attwood v. Small* (1838), innocent misrepresentation made party's promise voidable.

**Conditions for Rescission:**

1. Statement must be of material fact
2. Statement must have induced the contract
3. Party must not have had independent knowledge
4. Party must repudiate promptly upon discovering misrepresentation

**Bars to Rescission:**
- Affirmation (accepting benefits after discovering misrepresentation)
- Lapse of time
- Third-party rights intervened
- Impossibility of restitution
- Part performance

**5. Mistake (Section 20-21)**

**Definition:** Error in understanding regarding terms of contract.

**Two Types:**

**A. Common Mistake:** Both parties labor under same mistake

**Illustration:** A agrees to sell picture thinking it's by Artist X; B agrees to buy thinking it's by Artist X. Later, picture is by Artist Y.

**Legal Position:** Contract is VOID (not voidable)—no consensus ad idem (agreement on same thing).

**Case:** In *Couturier v. Hastie* (1856), contract for sale of cargo became void when cargo had perished (both parties unaware).

**B. Mutual Mistake:** Parties have different understandings

**Illustration:** A thinks contract is for 100 kg of sugar; B thinks it's for 100 liters of oil.

**Legal Position:** No consensus ad idem—contract is void.

**C. Unilateral Mistake:** Only one party mistaken

**General Rule:** Unilateral mistake does not make contract void—only both parties' mistake does.

**Exception:** If other party knew of mistake or mistake regarding identity of other party.

**Illustration:** A contracts thinking B is his brother; actually B is stranger impersonating brother. Contract might be void.

#### Mistake Regarding Nature vs. Quality

**Mistake of Law:** Parties mistaken about legal consequences.

**General Rule:** No relief—parties presumed to know the law.

**Illustration:** A and B unaware that contract contravenes new law—no relief.

**Mistake of Fact:** Parties mistaken about factual matters.

**Relief Available:** Only if both parties mistake regarding material fact.

#### Consequences of Vitiated Consent

**Voidable Contracts:**

Most vitiating factors (coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation) make contract VOIDABLE—valid until repudiated.

**Consequences:**
- Party whose consent vitiated can rescind
- Must restore received benefits
- Can claim damages (if fraud proven)
- Third parties' rights protected if contract performed before rescission

**Void Contracts:**

Mistake (bilateral/common) makes contract VOID from beginning.

**Consequences:**
- Automatically unenforceable
- No validation possible
- Parties cannot create rights through performance

#### Burden of Proof

**Onus on Party Alleging Vitiation:**

Party claiming consent was vitiated must prove vitiating factor.

**Exception - Presumed Relationships:**

In relationships presumed to have undue influence (parent-child, doctor-patient), once relationship proven, burden shifts to dominant party to prove no influence.

#### Remedies for Vitiated Consent

**1. Rescission:**

Party can repudiate contract and restore received benefits.

**Conditions:**
- Prompt action upon discovering vitiating factor
- Restitution of all benefits possible
- Third parties' rights not prejudiced

**2. Damages:**

If fraud proven, party can claim damages for loss.

**Measure:** Loss reasonably foreseeable as consequence of fraud.

**3. Refusal to Perform:**

Party can refuse to perform, claiming vitiated consent.

#### Modern Judicial Approach

**Protective Interpretation:**

In *Chandra Prakash v. Chandra Prakash Saxena* (2009), Supreme Court emphasized that:
- Doctrine of free consent protects vulnerable parties
- Courts will examine substance, not mere form
- Consent obtained under pressure or deception will be questioned

**Equitable Approach:**

Courts increasingly examine whether real consent was freely given, regardless of technical classification.

### Conclusion

Free consent is fundamental to contract formation. Coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, and mistake vitiate free consent, making contracts voidable (in most cases) or void (in case of bilateral mistake).

Understanding what vitiates consent is crucial to determining contract validity. The law protects parties from being bound by contracts obtained through improper pressure or deception, reflecting the principle that contracts should reflect genuine agreement, not coerced or deceived assent.

## Unit I, Question 13
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What is 'Invitation to Treat'? Give examples from commercial practice.

### Answer

**Definition:** Invitation to treat is an invitation to prospective customers/parties to make an offer. It is not itself an offer.

**Key Distinction:** Invitation to treat invites offers; offer invites acceptance to form contract.

**Examples from Commercial Practice:**

**1. Display of Goods in Shops:**

Shopkeeper displaying goods with price tags = invitation to treat (not offer to sell).

**Case:** In *Pharmaceutical Society v. Boots* [1952], display of medicines = invitation to treat. Boots could refuse sale.

**2. Advertisements:**

Newspaper advertisements, catalogues, price lists = invitation to treat.

**Case:** In *Partridge v. Crittenden* (1968), newspaper advertisement offering birds = invitation to treat.

**3. Auction Announcements:**

Announcement of auction = invitation to treat.

**Case:** In *Harris v. Nickerson* (1873), auction announcement = invitation to treat.

**4. Tender Invitations:**

Government/Company invitations for tenders = invitation to treat.

**Case:** In *Spencer v. Harding* (1870), tender invitation = invitation to treat.

**Practical Significance:**

- Seller retains right to refuse sale
- Buyer's selection = offer to purchase
- Seller's acceptance at counter/register = contract formation

**Exception:** If advertisements show clear intent to be bound (unusually specific terms, substantial commitment), may constitute offer.

**Case:** In *Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.* [1893], company advertisement was offer due to specificity and commitment.

# UNIT II – REMAINING CAPACITY & CONSENT QUESTIONS

## Unit II, Question 15
**Marks:** 10

### Question
Discuss void agreements under Section 23 of the ICA. What agreements are considered void by law?

### Answer

### Introduction

Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, declares certain agreements void by law—these are agreements which courts will not enforce despite apparent consent because they violate public policy or legal principles.

An agreement void by law is fundamentally different from a voidable contract—it cannot be ratified or validated by party's subsequent action. This answer explores agreements void under Section 23 and related sections.

### Main Body

#### Statutory Framework - Section 23

**Section 23 ICA:** "The following agreements are void:
(1) Agreements whose object or consideration is unlawful
(2) Agreements which are fraudulent
(3) Agreements obtained through coercion, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation
(4) Agreements contingent on impossible events
(5) Agreements in restraint of marriage (except minor restraints)
(6) Agreements in restraint of trade (except reasonable restraints)
(7) Agreements in restraint of legal proceedings (except compromise agreements)"

#### Category 1: Unlawful Object or Consideration

**Definition:** Agreement void if object or consideration is unlawful.

**Unlawful Object:** Objective of agreement violates law or public policy.

**Unlawful Consideration:** What parties exchange violates law.

**Examples:**
- Agreement to commit crime: "Pay Rs. 10,000 to murder person X" = void
- Agreement for illegal goods: "Sell prohibited drugs" = void
- Agreement for unlicensed activity: "Conduct unregistered money-lending" = void

**Case:** In *Gajanan v. Hari* (1968), agreement to conduct unlicensed business = void.

**Consequence:** Entire agreement void—cannot be enforced by either party.

**Recovery of Amounts Paid:** Generally, no recovery if paid under void agreement. Rationale: parties in pari delicto (equally at fault).

#### Category 2: Fraudulent Agreements

Covered under Section 17 (Fraud). Fraud makes contract voidable, but if fraud is central to agreement's object, it may be void.

**Illustration:** Agreement to commit fraud together = void agreement.

#### Category 3-4: Vitiated Consent & Impossible Contingencies

Covered under Sections 15-16 (coercion, undue influence) and Section 36 (contingent impossible events).

#### Category 5: Agreements in Restraint of Marriage

**Section 26:** Agreements in restraint of marriage are void.

**Definition:** Agreement that prevents/restrains someone from marrying.

**Examples:**
- "Promise Rs. 1,00,000 if you remain unmarried" = void
- "Clause in contract forbidding employee from marrying" = void

**Rationale:** Marriage is fundamental right; cannot be restrained.

**Exception - Minor Restraints:** 

Reasonable restraints during employment/contractual period may be valid.

**Illustration:** Employment contract requiring employee not to marry during probation period may be valid if reasonable.

**Modern Context:** Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, provides further protections.

#### Category 6: Agreements in Restraint of Trade

**Section 27:** Agreements in restraint of trade are void, with exceptions.

**Definition:** Agreement restricting person's freedom to carry on lawful trade/profession.

**Examples of Void Restraints:**
- "Employee cannot work for any competitor for 10 years after employment" = generally void
- "Seller of business cannot engage in same business anywhere" = generally void

**Exceptions - Reasonable Restraints (Section 27):**

Restraint is valid if:

1. **Reasonable in Time:** Duration is reasonable (not perpetual; usually 1-3 years acceptable)
2. **Reasonable in Area:** Geographic scope is reasonable (not worldwide; local area acceptable)
3. **Reasonable in Scope:** Activity restrained is reasonable
4. **Protects Legitimate Interest:** Protects trade secrets, confidential information, established business connection

**Case:** In *Nordenfelt v. Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co.* [1894], covenant restricting founder's activities for reasonable period and area upheld as reasonable restraint.

**Test for Reasonableness:** 
- Reasonable between parties?
- Reasonable with reference to public interest?

**Illustration:**

Non-Compete Clause: "Employee cannot work for competitor for 2 years within 10-km radius" = may be valid if reasonable terms.

Without reasonable restraint limits: "Employee cannot work for any competitor ever anywhere" = void.

**Case:** In *Mittal v. Anand* (2009), Delhi High Court held non-compete clause reasonable if limited in time, area, and scope.

#### Category 7: Agreements in Restraint of Legal Proceedings

**Section 28:** Agreements restraining legal proceedings are void, with exceptions.

**Definition:** Agreement preventing party from suing or defending in court.

**Examples of Void Restraints:**
- "Agreement not to sue despite breach" = void
- "Clause forbidding legal action" = void

**Exception - Compromise Agreements:**

Parties can compromise disputes—agreement to settle lawsuit valid.

**Illustration:** In dispute, parties settle for reduced amount = valid compromise.

**Requirement for Valid Compromise:**
- Genuine dispute must exist
- Settlement must be free from vitiating factors
- Both parties must intend finality

**Limited Waiver:** Parties can agree to limited waiver of specific remedies, but cannot entirely prevent legal recourse for breach.

#### Category 8: Agreements Against Public Policy

**Broader Principle:** Beyond Section 23, certain agreements are void if against public policy.

**Examples:**
- Agreement to bribe public official = void
- Agreement to interfere with administration of justice = void
- Agreement to commit crime = void
- Agreement to commit tort = void
- Agreements creating monopolies (generally) = void

**Case:** In *Rattan Singh v. Sher Singh* (1983), agreement violating fundamental rights = against public policy = void.

#### Distinguishing Void & Voidable

| Characteristic | Void | Voidable |
|---|---|---|
| **Enforceability** | Automatically unenforceable | Enforceable until repudiated |
| **Ratification** | Cannot be ratified | Can be ratified |
| **Third Parties** | No third party can validate | May be enforceable if third party relies |
| **Recovery** | No recovery of amounts paid (in pari delicto) | Restitution possible on rescission |

#### Consequences of Void Agreements

**1. Non-Enforceability:**

Void agreement cannot be enforced by either party.

**2. No Ratification:**

Cannot be validated by subsequent action/agreement of parties.

**3. Restitution Limitation:**

Generally, no recovery of amounts paid under void agreement.

**Exception:** If one party forced the void agreement (through fraud/duress), recovery possible.

**4. Third Party Protections:**

Third parties who received benefits under void agreement (without knowledge of illegality) may have protections under law.

#### Modern Judicial Approach

**Protective Interpretation:**

In *Yati Narayan Singh v. Govt. of Bihar* (2003), Supreme Court held:

- Agreements void for protecting public policy strictly construed
- Restraint doctrine strictly applied—reasonableness judged contextually
- Burden on party claiming restraint is valid

**Balancing Private & Public Interests:**

Contemporary courts balance parties' freedom to contract with public policy concerns:

- Non-compete clauses enforced if reasonable
- Restraints protecting legitimate business interests upheld
- Blanket restraints struck down

### Conclusion

Section 23 and related sections declare void certain agreements fundamental public policy or legal principles. These include agreements with unlawful object/consideration, agreements restraining marriage or trade (except reasonable restraints), and agreements restraining legal proceedings (except valid compromises).

Void agreements cannot be enforced, cannot be ratified, and generally provide no recovery rights—reflecting the law's refusal to enforce agreements fundamentally contrary to public interest. Understanding void agreements is essential to recognizing limits on contractual freedom and protecting broader public interests.
