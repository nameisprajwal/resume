## Question
What are the different modes of discharge of contract? Explain discharge by frustration of contract.

## Answer

### Introduction

Discharge of a contract means termination of the contractual obligations of the parties. When a contract is discharged, the parties are freed from their mutual obligations. Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act provides the general framework for discharge of contracts. The different modes of discharge reflect various circumstances under which contractual obligations may come to an end. Frustration of contract is a particularly important doctrine in modern contract law, recognizing that sometimes performance becomes impossible due to supervening events beyond the control of the parties.

### Main Body

#### Different Modes of Discharge of Contract

**1. Discharge by Performance:**

When a party performs the contractual obligations according to the terms of the contract, the contract is discharged. In *Hadley v. Baxendale* (1854), it was established that proper and complete performance satisfies the contractual obligation. Performance must be:
- According to the terms of the contract
- At the specified time and place
- In the manner specified

**2. Discharge by Agreement:**

Section 62 provides that a contract may be discharged by mutual agreement of the parties. This may be:
- **Express Agreement:** The parties explicitly agree to cancel or modify the contract.
- **Implied Agreement:** The conduct of the parties implies agreement to terminate. In *Scammell v. Ouston* (1941), it was held that an implied agreement to abandon a contract is valid if supported by consideration.

**3. Discharge by Breach:**

When one party breaches the contract, the innocent party may treat the contract as discharged and sue for damages. In *Frost v. Knight* (1872), the principle of anticipatory breach was established. An actual breach occurs when a party fails to perform on the due date or thereafter.

**4. Discharge by Impossibility of Performance (Frustration):**

When performance becomes impossible due to supervening events, the contract is frustrated and discharged. This is discussed in detail below.

**5. Discharge by Lapse of Time:**

When the time fixed for performance expires without performance, and no new time is fixed, the contract is discharged by operation of law. In *Badri Nath v. Deoki Prasad* (1968), the Supreme Court held that lapse of time without performance terminates contractual obligations.

**6. Discharge by Renunciation:**

When a party renounces the contract through words or conduct, indicating an unwillingness to perform, the contract may be discharged. In *V. Banerjee v. Laxmi* (1970), renunciation was distinguished from repudiation.

**7. Discharge by Operation of Law:**

Contracts may be discharged by operation of law in the following cases:
- **Bankruptcy:** The bankruptcy of one party discharges the contract.
- **Death:** In contracts involving personal services, death of the obligated party discharges the contract.
- **Merger:** When a right arising from a contract merges into a larger right, the contract is discharged.

#### Discharge by Frustration (Doctrine of Frustration)

**Definition and Concept:**

Frustration occurs when supervening events make performance of a contract impossible or radically different from what was originally contemplated by the parties. It refers to cases where after the formation of a contract but before performance, an event occurs making performance:
- Physically impossible
- Illegal
- Radically different from what was contemplated

**Legal Principle:**

In *Taylor v. Caldwell* (1863), Lord Blackburn established the principle that if a contract is made to do something which cannot afterwards be done if the circumstances in which the contract was made this becomes impossible through the act of God or other cause for which neither party is answerable, and has not either taken upon himself the express responsibility, the contract is at an end.

In the Indian context, in *N.V. Dujar & Co. v. Syndicate Ltd.* (1980), the Supreme Court held that the doctrine of frustration applies when performance becomes impossible due to circumstances beyond the control of both parties.

**Grounds for Frustration:**

1. **Destruction of Subject Matter:**
If the specific thing that is the subject matter of the contract is destroyed, the contract is frustrated. In *C. Sharpe & Co. v. Nosher* (1918), when a ship that was to be chartered was destroyed by fire before delivery, the contract was frustrated.

2. **Death or Disability:**
In contracts involving personal services, death or incapacity of the obligated party frustrates the contract. In *Robinson v. Davison* (1871), when a pianist was unable to perform due to illness, the contract was frustrated.

3. **Supervening Illegality:**
When a contract becomes illegal due to subsequent legislation or government action, it is frustrated. During World War I, contracts with enemy aliens became frustrated due to the Trading with the Enemy Act.

4. **Non-Occurrence of Contemplated Event:**
When a contract is based on the occurrence of a specific event and that event fails to materialize, the contract may be frustrated. In *Krell v. Henry* [1903], a contract for the hire of a flat to view the coronation procession of King Edward VII was frustrated when the coronation was postponed due to the King's illness.

5. **Commercial Impracticability:**
When performance is not impossible but becomes commercially impracticable or extremely difficult, some jurisdictions recognize frustration. However, the Indian courts have been reluctant to apply this doctrine extensively.

**The Indian Position:**

In *English Assurance Corp. Ltd. v. Kosmar Villa Holidays* (2008), the Supreme Court stated that frustration requires:
- A supervening event
- The event must have been unforeseeable at the time of contract formation
- Performance must become impossible, not merely difficult
- The impossibility must be absolute, not relative

**Illustrations of Frustration:**

1. **War and Hostilities:** In *Jackson v. Union Marine Insurance Co.* (1874), a ship chartered to carry cargo became stranded on rocks, and the war that followed made the voyage impossible. The contract was frustrated.

2. **Government Action:** In *Metropolitan Water Board v. Dick Kerr & Co.* (1918), a contract for construction work was suspended by government order. The contract was held frustrated.

3. **Essential Government License:** In *Denny Mott & Dickson Ltd. v. James B. Fraser Ltd.* (1944), without a government license, the contract could not be performed. It was frustrated.

**Effects of Frustration:**

According to Section 56(1) of the Indian Contract Act: "If, in a contract, a condition precedent fails or subsequent event makes performance impossible, or as [the law now stands] would amount to a breach, the contract becomes void."

- The contract becomes void
- Both parties are discharged from performance
- Each party retains rights to sue for damages for any breach
- Under Section 65, amounts paid become recoverable
- Under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act principles adapted in India, losses are apportioned equitably

**Limitations on Frustration Doctrine:**

1. **Foreseeability:** If the event was foreseeable, the doctrine does not apply.
2. **Express Provision:** If the contract contains a clause addressing the supervening event, frustration does not apply.
3. **Partial Impossibility:** Mere difficulty in performance does not amount to frustration.
4. **Self-Induced Frustration:** If a party causes the frustrating event, the doctrine does not apply.

In *Paradine v. Jane* (1647), an old principle was that a party who contracted to do something must do it unless he expressly provided for contingencies. This strict position has been substantially modified by the doctrine of frustration, though not entirely abandoned.

### Conclusion

Contracts are discharged through various modes including performance, agreement, breach, frustration, lapse of time, and operation of law. The doctrine of frustration is a critical exception to the principle that contracts must be performed as promised. It recognizes that when supervening, unforeseeable events make performance impossible—whether through destruction of subject matter, death, illegality, or non-occurrence of contemplated events—both parties are freed from their contractual obligations. This doctrine balances the principle of sanctity of contracts with the practical reality that some events lie entirely beyond the parties' control. However, courts apply the doctrine cautiously, ensuring that ordinary commercial difficulty and increased expense do not suffice to trigger frustration, which remains an extraordinary remedy available only when performance becomes truly impossible.
