## Question
"An agreement enforceable by law is a contract." Discuss.

## Answer

### Introduction

The definition of a contract is fundamental to contract law and forms the cornerstone of all contractual relationships. Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, succinctly defines a contract as "an agreement made with the free consent of the parties, competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and which is not hereby expressly declared to be void." However, the statement under consideration takes a narrower approach by defining a contract as "an agreement enforceable by law." This perspective emphasizes the enforcement mechanism as the defining characteristic of a contract. This answer explores the validity of this statement and its nuances within the framework of Indian contract law.

### Main Body

#### Definition and Concept of Contract

A contract is not merely any agreement between two parties; it is an agreement that possesses legal enforceability. The distinction between an agreement and a contract is critically important. An agreement is a generic term that encompasses any mutual understanding between parties, whereas a contract is a specialized form of agreement that satisfies certain legal requirements and enjoys judicial enforcement.

**Key Elements Distinguishing Contracts from Mere Agreements:**

1. **Consideration:** Every contract must involve consideration, which can be defined as something of value exchanged between the parties. In *Currie v. Misa* [1875], it was established that consideration is essential to the formation of a contract. The Indian Contract Act recognizes this principle in Section 2(d), where consideration is defined as "when the other party suffers some detriment or the promisee acquires some benefit, or both, the latter is said to have furnished a consideration for the promisor's promise."

2. **Lawful Object:** The subject matter of the agreement must be lawful. Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act declares void any agreement that has an unlawful object, or that is fraudulent, injures the person or property of anyone, or is otherwise opposed to public policy.

3. **Legal Capacity:** The parties entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity to do so. This is governed by Sections 11-16 of the Indian Contract Act. Persons who are competent to contract include those who have attained majority, are of sound mind, and are not disqualified by law.

4. **Free Consent:** The agreement must be formed with the free consent of the parties. Section 13 defines consent as "when two or more persons agree upon the same thing in the same sense." Section 14 further stipulates that consent is "free" when it is not vitiated by coercion (Section 15), undue influence (Section 16), fraud (Section 17), misrepresentation (Section 18), or mistake (Sections 20-22).

#### Enforceability as the Defining Characteristic

The statement "an agreement enforceable by law is a contract" emphasizes enforceability as the distinguishing feature of contracts. This definition is correct insofar as it recognizes that what separates a contract from a mere social or moral obligation is the right of one party to enforce it against the other through legal proceedings.

**Supporting Case Law:**

In *Scammell v. Ouston* [1941], it was held that enforceability is a fundamental characteristic of a contract. Where an agreement is vague, uncertain, or incomplete, it cannot be enforced and is therefore not a contract.

The Indian Supreme Court in *Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.* [1893] (which has been applied extensively in Indian jurisprudence) established that a contract requires not only mutual assent but also the mutual intention to be legally bound. The Court stated that the parties must intend to create legal relations. If an agreement is made without such intention, it may remain a mere gentlemen's agreement and cannot be enforced.

#### The Reciprocal Relationship

However, it is important to note that the statement presents a somewhat circular definition. All enforceable agreements are contracts, and all contracts must be enforceable, but an agreement must first satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be deemed enforceable.

In *Waghorn v. Waghorn* (1869), the court held that whether an agreement is a contract depends on whether the parties intended it to be binding in law. This subjective test complements the objective requirements of consideration, legality, and capacity.

#### Void Agreements and Limited Enforceability

Not all agreements that fail certain legal requirements are entirely devoid of contractual character. Some agreements may be enforceable against certain parties or under certain circumstances. For instance:

- Under Section 27, agreements in restraint of trade are void, but Section 28 provides exceptions where such agreements are valid if they are reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate interests.
- Section 24 provides that agreements opposed to public policy are void, but this does not mean such agreements produce no legal effects whatsoever—they may still impose moral obligations or give rise to quasi-contractual rights.

#### The Issue of Validity vs. Enforceability

A critical distinction exists between a contract being "valid" and being "enforceable." In *Goldstein v. Levytov* [1936], it was held that a contract may exist but be unenforceable for certain reasons (such as non-compliance with the Statute of Limitations). The existence of a contract and its enforceability are thus not necessarily synonymous.

Similarly, under Section 31 of the Indian Contract Act, an agreement in restraint of marriage is void, meaning it has no legal effect and cannot be enforced; yet the agreement itself may exist as a factual matter.

### Conclusion

The statement "an agreement enforceable by law is a contract" is substantially correct, but it requires refinement. More accurately, a contract is an agreement that:

1. Satisfies all legal requirements (consideration, lawful object, legal capacity, free consent)
2. Is intended by the parties to create legal relations
3. Is enforceable through legal proceedings by any party aggrieved by its breach

Enforceability is indeed the hallmark of a contract and what distinguishes it from a mere agreement, but enforceability is contingent upon the agreement satisfying certain fundamental legal requirements. Thus, while all contracts must be enforceable agreements, not all agreements are contracts—only those meeting the legal criteria for formation and lacking grounds for voidability achieve contractual status.

The definition is therefore functionally accurate but should be understood as the culmination of several legal requirements rather than an independent criterion.
