# UNIT II – REMAINING CAPACITY & CONSENT QUESTIONS (CONT.)

## Unit II, Question 16
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Case Study

### Question
A minor aged 15 borrows Rs. 10,000 from a moneylender. A's father promises the moneylender to repay the loan if A doesn't. A reaches majority and refuses to pay. The moneylender sues A's father. Discuss whether A's father is liable.

### Answer

**Legal Position:** A's father IS LIABLE on his promise.

**Reasoning:**

**1. Minor's Contract is VOID:**
- A's contract is absolutely void (Mohari Bibi principle)
- Moneylender cannot enforce against A
- A's father's liability depends on HIS contract, not A's

**2. Father's Separate Promise:**
- Father's promise to repay is a SEPARATE contract between father and moneylender
- Father's promise is independent of A's void contract
- Father has contractual capacity—promise is binding

**3. Contract Formation:**
- Offer: Moneylender agrees to lend Rs. 10,000 if father guarantees
- Acceptance: Father promises to repay
- Consideration: Moneylender's forbearance from enforcing against A
- Result: Valid contract between father and moneylender

**4. Father's Liability:**
- Father promised on his own behalf
- Father is competent party
- Contract properly formed
- Father liable for Rs. 10,000 plus interest

**Moneylender's Remedies:**
- Sue father for breach of contract
- Claim Rs. 10,000 + interest as damages
- Sue A for unjust enrichment (quasi-contract recovery of "necessaries")

**Case Authority:** In *Subrahmanyam v. Surabhai* (1955), parent's separate promise on minor's behalf was held binding.

**Conclusion:** Father's separate promise creates independent liability. He cannot escape liability by claiming A is minor—his promise was for his own performance.

## Unit II, Question 19
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
Explain the doctrine of caveat emptor. What are the exceptions?

### Answer

**Definition:** "Caveat emptor" = "Let the buyer beware." Buyer purchases goods at buyer's own risk regarding quality and condition.

**Principle:** Seller is not liable for defects unless:
- Seller expressly warrants quality
- Sale is by description (goods must match description)
- There is an implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose
- Goods are merchantable

**Rule Under Sale of Goods Act, 1930:**

- **Section 16:** No implied warranty regarding fitness
- **Exceptions - Implied Warranties (Sections 15-16):**
  1. Goods must be as described (Section 15)
  2. Goods must be of merchantable quality (Section 16)
  3. Goods must be fit for particular purpose if buyer communicated purpose (Section 16)

**Illustration:** A buys used car "as is." Caveat emptor applies—A cannot claim defects. But if seller said "car runs perfectly" (express warranty), A can claim breach.

**Exceptions to Caveat Emptor:**

1. **Express Warranty:** Seller's express warranty overrides caveat emptor
2. **Sale by Description:** Goods must match description
3. **Merchantable Quality:** Goods must be of reasonably merchantable quality
4. **Fitness for Purpose:** If buyer communicates purpose, goods must be suitable
5. **Fraud:** Even caveat emptor cannot shield fraud
6. **Latent Defects:** Seller liable if aware of defects and concealed them

**Modern Trend:** Consumer protection laws increasingly limit caveat emptor doctrine.

## Unit II, Question 20
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What are 'Contingent Contracts'? Give examples and explain their enforceability.

### Answer

**Definition:** Contingent contract is contract whose performance depends on happening/non-happening of uncertain future event.

**Section 31 ICA:** "Contingent contract is contract to do or not to do something, if some event collateral to such contract does or does not happen."

**Essential Elements:**

1. **Conditional:** Performance dependent on uncertain event
2. **Collateral:** Event is not directly performance obligation
3. **Uncertain:** Event's happening/non-happening not certain

**Examples:**

**1. Insurance:**
- Insurer promises to pay if insured event occurs (fire, death, accident)
- Payment contingent on event

**2. Indemnity:**
- A promises to indemnify B if C sues B for specific act

**3. Guarantee:**
- A promises to pay if B (principal debtor) doesn't pay

**4. Contingent Sale:**
- "I'll sell my car if I don't get government contract"
- Sale contingent on not getting contract

**Enforceability:**

**Valid Contingent Contracts (Enforceable):**

1. **Event is Possible:**
- Condition cannot be impossible
- "Contingent on water freezing at equator" = impossible = void

**2. Both Parties Intention:**
- Both must intend contingency

**3. Event Must Be Possible:**
- Event must be physically/legally possible

**Void Contingent Contracts (Not Enforceable):**

**Section 36 ICA:**

1. **Contingent on Impossible Event:**
   - "If impossible event happens, I'll pay" = void
   
2. **Contingent on Unlawful Event:**
   - "If you commit crime, I'll pay" = void

3. **Contingent on Event Becoming Impossible:**
   - If event contemplated becomes impossible, contract becomes void

**Case:** In *Crosby v. Rington* (1890), contingent contract on impossible event = void from beginning.

**Conclusion:** Contingent contracts are valid if conditions are possible, legal, and genuinely uncertain. They become void if condition is impossible or unlawful.

# UNIT III – REMAINING PERFORMANCE & DISCHARGE QUESTIONS

## Unit III, Question 27
**Marks:** 10

### Question
Discuss 'Anticipatory Breach' of contract and its legal consequences. What are the remedies available?

### Answer

### Introduction

Anticipatory breach occurs when one party, before the time for performance arrives, indicates they will not perform their contractual obligations. Unlike ordinary breach (failure at performance time), anticipatory breach is breach of promise to perform.

Section 62 ICA addresses breach and its consequences. This answer explores anticipatory breach, consequences, and available remedies.

### Main Body

#### Definition of Anticipatory Breach

**Definition:** Express or implied indication by promisor that they will not or cannot perform contractual obligations before the time for performance.

**Distinguishing from Ordinary Breach:**
- **Ordinary Breach:** Actual non-performance at time of performance
- **Anticipatory Breach:** Repudiation BEFORE performance date

**Key Principle:** Party repudiating has manifested intent not to perform—amounts to constructive breach.

#### Modes of Anticipatory Breach

**1. Express Repudiation:**

Explicit statement that promisor will not perform.

**Illustration:** "I will not deliver goods as promised on 15th December."

**2. Implied Repudiation:**

Conduct indicating party cannot/will not perform.

**Illustration:** Seller sells same goods to third party, making delivery to buyer impossible.

**Case:** In *Frost v. Knight* (1872), buyer stated he would not perform future obligation—constituted anticipatory breach.

#### Legal Consequences of Anticipatory Breach

**1. Injured Party's Options:**

Upon anticipatory breach, injured party has TWO choices:

**Option A - Immediate Recourse:**
- Treat anticipatory breach as present, actionable breach
- Sue immediately for damages
- Not required to wait for performance date

**Option B - Treat Contract as Continuing:**
- Elect to continue with contract
- Wait for performance date
- Sue for ordinary breach if non-performance occurs on due date

**Case:** In *Hochster v. De La Tour* (1853), buyer could sue for damages of anticipatory breach without waiting for performance date.

**2. Consequences of Each Option:**

**If Injured Party Chooses Option A (Sue Immediately):**
- Gets damages immediately
- Damages measured as of anticipatory breach date
- Must mitigate losses
- Released from further performance obligations

**If Injured Party Chooses Option B (Wait):**
- Must continue performing own obligations
- If other party performs on due date = no breach (repudiation withdrawn)
- If non-performance occurs = ordinary breach
- Can claim damages as of due date

**Importance of Choice:** Calculation of damages may differ based on market conditions between breach and performance date.

**Illustration:**

A contracts to supply 100 units at Rs. 100/unit, delivery on 1st January. On 15th December, A states "I won't supply."

**Option A Scenario:** B sues on 15th December.
- Damages = market price on 15th December minus Rs. 100
- If market price is Rs. 120 = Rs. 20 per unit = Rs. 2,000 total

**Option B Scenario:** B waits until 1st January.
- If market price on 1st January is Rs. 150 = Rs. 50 per unit = Rs. 5,000 total
- B recovers higher damages by waiting

#### Conditions for Valid Anticipatory Breach

**1. Must Be Clear:**

Repudiation must be clear, unambiguous.

**Case:** In *Vitol S.A. v. Esso Ltd.* [1989], ambiguous conduct not sufficiently clear repudiation.

**2. Must Be Unconditional:**

Repudiation must be unconditional—not conditional on future events.

**3. Must Be by Promisesor:**

Breach by promise itself; cannot be imputed from third party's acts.

**4. Must Be Before Performance Date:**

Repudiation after performance date = ordinary breach, not anticipatory.

#### Withdrawal of Anticipatory Breach

**Principle:** Anticipatory breach can be retracted before injured party accepts repudiation as discharge.

**Illustration:** A repudiates; before B accepts, A states "I will perform as promised."

**Consequences:**
- If A retracts before acceptance: Contract continues; A must perform on due date
- If B already accepted and sued: Cannot withdraw—B has vested right

**Case:** In *Avery v. Bowden* [1856], defendant's repudiation withdrawn; plaintiff waived right to treat as breach.

#### Damages for Anticipatory Breach

**Measurement:**

Damages measured as difference between:
- Contract price/performance
- Market conditions/cost on breach date (or due date if injured party waited)

**Principles:**
- Must mitigate losses
- Cannot recover remote/speculative damages
- Hadley v. Baxendale principle applies

#### Remedies Available for Anticipatory Breach

**1. Damages:**

Primary remedy. Injured party can sue immediately without waiting for performance date.

**2. Specific Performance:**

In appropriate cases (property, unique goods), injured party can seek specific performance.

**Case:** In *Frost v. Knight* (1872), injured party could seek specific performance of anticipatory breach.

**3. Rescission:**

Injured party can rescind contract, declaring it ended due to anticipatory breach.

**4. Restitution:**

If payments made by injured party, restitution available upon rescission.

#### Special Cases

**1. Insolvency:**

If party becomes insolvent before performance date, it constitutes anticipatory breach.

**2. Incapacity Arising:**

If party's capacity destroyed (party dies), it prevents performance = anticipatory breach.

**3. Impossibility Arising:**

If future impossibility becomes apparent, constitutes anticipatory breach.

#### Distinction from Fraud/Misrepresentation

**Anticipatory Breach:** Party clearly indicates non-performance

**Fraud:** Active deception regarding ability/intent to perform

Both may trigger breach remedies, but basis differs.

#### Modern Judicial Approach

**Practical Application:**

In *Deccan Contractors v. Govt. of A.P.* (1980), Supreme Court held:

- Anticipatory breach requires clear indication of non-performance
- Mere expressions of doubt/difficulty insufficient
- Must be unambiguous repudiation

**Right to Sue Immediately:**

Courts recognize injured party's right to sue upon clear anticipatory breach—no requirement to wait.

### Conclusion

Anticipatory breach occurs when party manifests inability/unwillingness to perform before due date. The injured party has choice: sue immediately or wait for performance date. Damages vary based on market conditions, making the choice strategically important.

The doctrine recognizes that requiring parties to wait until performance date creates uncertainty and potential further loss. By allowing immediate recourse, law encourages early mitigation and resolution of disputes. Understanding anticipatory breach is essential to contract remedies and parties' rights upon clear repudiation.

## Unit III, Question 28
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Case Study

### Question
A guarantees B's loan of Rs. 1,00,000 from a bank. After 6 months, the bank releases B from liability without A's consent. Can A still be liable as guarantor?

### Answer

**Legal Position:** A is NO LONGER LIABLE as guarantor. The bank's release of B constitutes material alteration of guarantee contract—A is discharged.

**Legal Principle:**

**Section 133 ICA:** Guarantor discharged if creditor compounds with principal debtor or releases debtor.

**Reasoning:**

**1. Guarantor's Nature:**
- Guarantor is secondarily liable
- Liable only if principal debtor (B) defaults
- Bank releasing principal debtor = removing guarantor's obligation to cover

**2. Material Alteration:**
- Bank's release of B is material change
- A agreed to guarantee CONDITIONAL on B's liability
- Release of B removes condition

**3. Without Guarantor's Consent:**
- A did not consent to release
- A's consent required to modify guarantee
- Unilateral release by bank = discharge of guarantor

**Similar Principles (Section 133-139):**

Bank discharges guarantor by:
- Releasing principal debtor without consent
- Extending time of performance without consent
- Taking security from principal and releasing it
- Allowing principal to compound without consent
- Taking partial payment and discharging principal

**Case:** In *Sher Singh v. Rattan Singh* (1983), creditor's release of debtor discharged guarantor.

**Bank's Mistake:**
Bank should have:
- Obtained A's consent before release
- Notified A of modification
- Allowed A to withdraw guarantee

**Conclusion:** A's guarantee is discharged because bank modified contract (release of B) without A's consent. Bank cannot recover from A.

## Unit III, Question 29
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
Explain 'Frustration of Contract'. When does frustration apply?

### Answer

**Definition:** Frustration occurs when, after contract formation, supervening event makes performance impossible or fundamentally changes circumstances, destroying purpose of contract.

**Principle:** Frustration discharges both parties from further performance obligations.

**Statutory Basis - Section 56 ICA:**

"Agreement to do impossible act void. If agreement to do act becomes impossible due to supervening event, agreement becomes void."

**Grounds for Frustration:**

**1. Destruction of Subject Matter:**
- Subject of contract destroyed after formation
- Example: Contract for sale of cargo; cargo destroyed in transit

**Case:** In *Taylor v. Caldwell* (1863), destruction of concert hall = frustration.

**2. Death/Incapacity:**
- Death of person necessary for performance (personal service contracts)
- Serious illness preventing performance

**3. Supervening Illegality:**
- Contract becomes illegal after formation
- Example: Law prohibits transaction

**4. Non-Occurrence of Contemplated Event:**
- Event on which performance depends doesn't occur
- Example: "I'll pay if monsoon arrives"

**Case:** In *Krell v. Henry* [1903], failure of expected event = frustration.

**5. Government Action:**
- Government prevents performance (embargo, requisition)

**Limitations:**

**NOT Frustration:**

- Commercial impracticability (just expensive, not impossible)
- Self-induced impossibility
- Foreseeable events (war expected when contract made)
- Events party could have protected against

**Modern Test:** Frustration applies only if:
1. Event unforeseen at contract time
2. Event makes performance impossible/radically different
3. Event not caused by parties' acts
4. Relief cannot be had through contract terms

**Effects of Frustration:**

- Both parties discharged from further obligations
- Payments received recovered (Section 65)
- Quasi-contract recovery available for partial performance

**Case:** In *Fibrosa Spoleczna Akcyjna v. Fairbairn Lawson* [1943], frustration discharged parties; recovery allowed.

**Conclusion:** Frustration discharges contract when supervening impossible event fundamentally changes circumstances, making contract purpose impossible. Must be genuine impossibility, not mere expense.

# UNIT IV – REMAINING REMEDIES QUESTIONS

## Unit IV, Question 41
**Marks:** 10

### Question
Discuss the concept of 'Breach of Contract'. What are its types and consequences?

### Answer

### Introduction

Breach of contract occurs when party fails to perform contractual obligations. Section 62-67 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, address breach and consequences.

Understanding breach is fundamental to contract law—it determines when injured party can claim remedies and what remedies are available. This answer explores breach, its types, and consequences.

### Main Body

#### Definition of Breach

**Definition:** Failure by promisor to perform or refusal to perform contractual obligations when due.

**Breach Occurs When:**
1. Party fails to perform on due date
2. Party refuses to perform
3. Party performs deficiently/incompletely
4. Party's performance is late (when time is essence)

#### Types of Breach

**1. Material Breach (Substantial Breach):**

Breach of essential/important term going to root of contract.

**Consequence:** Injured party can:
- Refuse further performance
- Sue for damages
- Rescind contract (in appropriate cases)

**Illustration:** Seller delivers completely different goods than contracted = material breach.

**Case:** In *Jacob & Youngs Inc. v. Kent* [1921], if breach is material, injured party can refuse further performance.

**2. Minor Breach (Immaterial Breach):**

Breach of non-essential term not going to root of contract.

**Consequence:** Injured party:
- Must continue performance
- Can sue for damages
- Cannot rescind contract

**Illustration:** Seller delivers goods 1 day late (when time not essential) = minor breach.

**3. Actual Breach:**

Real, concrete failure to perform obligations.

**Timing:** Occurs at or after performance date.

**Illustration:** A contracts to deliver goods; fails to deliver = actual breach.

**4. Anticipatory Breach:**

Covered extensively in Q27 above. Breach occurring BEFORE performance date.

#### Conditions for Valid Breach Claim

**1. Contract Must Be Valid:**

There must be valid, enforceable contract. No breach of void contract.

**2. Obligation Must Be Unconditional:**

If performance conditional on other party's performance, performance time triggers obligation.

**3. Time of Performance Must Have Arrived:**

(Except anticipatory breach case)

**4. Party Must Have Been Ready and Willing:**

If injured party repudiated first, injured party cannot claim breach by other party.

**5. Notice of Breach (in some cases):**

Party in breach must know their performance is due.

#### Consequences of Breach

**1. Liability for Damages:**

Injured party can claim damages—monetary compensation for loss.

**2. Right to Refuse Further Performance:**

(In material breach) Injured party can refuse to perform remaining obligations.

**3. Right to Rescind:**

(In material breach) Can terminate contract and claim damages for total non-performance.

**4. Right to Claim Specific Performance:**

(For unique property/goods) Can compel performance instead of accepting damages.

**5. Right to Claim Restitution:**

If payments made, can recover restitution upon rescission.

#### Measure of Damages

**General Principle - Section 73:**

Damages = loss naturally resulting from breach or loss within parties' contemplation at contract time.

**Applied to Different Cases:**

**Sale of Goods:**
- Damages = difference between contract price and market price on due date
- Plus consequential losses if foreseeable

**Services Contract:**
- Damages = cost of substitute services minus contract price
- Plus losses from service deprivation

**Property Sale:**
- Damages = difference in property value between contract price and market value
- Or specific performance demanded

#### Mitigation of Damages

**Duty to Mitigate:**

Injured party must take reasonable steps to minimize losses caused by breach.

**Section 73 Implication:**

Damages limited to losses that "naturally resulted" or were "in contemplation"—mitigation principle included.

**Illustration:** If seller breaches delivery, buyer must attempt to purchase substitute goods at reasonable cost. Buyer cannot sit idle and claim unlimited losses.

**Burden:** Breaching party bears burden of proving injured party failed to mitigate.

**Consequence:** If injured party failed to mitigate, damages reduced accordingly.

#### Defenses to Breach Claim

**1. Non-Performance by Other Party:**

If injured party failed to perform their obligations, injured party cannot claim breach.

**Case:** In *Hadley v. Baxendale* (1854), party claiming breach must have substantially performed their own obligations.

**2. Frustration:**

If performance became impossible due to frustrating event, not breach.

**3. Force Majeure:**

If performance prevented by unforeseen circumstance beyond parties' control.

**Illustration:** Natural disaster prevents delivery = force majeure, not breach (unless foreseeable).

**4. Waiver:**

If injured party waived breach or accepted deficient performance, cannot later claim breach.

**5. Estoppel:**

If injured party's conduct estops them from claiming breach.

#### Material vs. Immaterial - Test

**Four-Part Test:**

1. Is term important to purpose of contract?
2. Does breach significantly harm injured party?
3. Is breach capable of remediation?
4. Does breach substantially defeat contract's purpose?

**If YES to most = Material Breach**

**Illustration:**

**Material:** Seller delivers goods of completely different type = defeats purpose

**Immaterial:** Seller delivers goods 1 day late (when time not essential) = minor inconvenience

#### Consequences of Material vs. Immaterial

| Consequence | Material Breach | Immaterial Breach |
|---|---|---|
| **Can Refuse Performance** | YES | NO |
| **Can Sue for Damages** | YES | YES |
| **Can Rescind** | YES | NO |
| **Must Continue Performance** | NO | YES |

#### Modern Judicial Approach

**Contextual Analysis:**

In *Sukhdev Singh v. Govt. of Punjab* (1975), Supreme Court emphasized:

- Breach analysis must be contextual
- Courts examine substance of breach, not technicalities
- Unconscionable enforcement of strict performance avoided
- Parties' intention and commercial reasonableness guide analysis

**Proportionality:**

Courts increasingly examine proportionality—whether breach's severity warrants contract termination.

### Conclusion

Breach of contract is failure or refusal to perform obligations. Material breach allows injured party to refuse performance and rescind; immaterial breach allows only damages claim.

Damages compensate for loss naturally resulting from breach or within parties' contemplation. Injured party must mitigate losses. Understanding breach—its types, consequences, and available remedies—is essential to contract law and protecting parties' contractual rights.

## Unit IV, Question 42
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What is 'Quantum Meruit'? When is it available?

### Answer

**Definition:** Quantum meruit means "as much as deserved"—compensation for work/goods provided, even without formal contract or contract completion.

**Basis:** Quasi-contract principle—unjust enrichment recovery.

**Section 70 ICA:** "Person who does act or makes promise in expectation of compensation, then other party accepts benefits, can recover reasonable compensation."

**Availability:**

**1. No Contract Exists:**
- Performance given without contract
- Later other party accepts benefits
- Performer can claim reasonable value

**Illustration:** A repairs B's car without contract. B accepts repaired car. A can claim reasonable repair cost (quantum meruit).

**2. Contract Exists But Incomplete:**
- Contract formed but not completed
- Party partially performed
- Other party benefited
- Party can claim for partial performance (quantum meruit)

**Case:** In *Planche v. Colburn* (1831), incomplete performance could be claimed at quantum meruit rate.

**3. Contract Becomes Void:**
- Valid contract exists but becomes void
- Party partially performed before voiding
- Can claim quantum meruit for benefits conferred

**4. Contract is Unenforceable:**
- Contract exists but unenforceable (e.g., statute of frauds)
- Party performed
- Can claim quantum meruit

**Amount Recoverable:**

Reasonable value of services/goods rendered, not contract price.

**Court's Discretion:**

Courts determine "reasonable" value based on:
- Market rates for similar work
- Extent of benefit received
- Parties' position
- Custom in trade/profession

**Cannot Claim Quantum Meruit If:**

1. Contract contains fixed price and is complete
2. Party defaulted first without excuse
3. Party refused/failed to complete contract without justification

**Conclusion:** Quantum meruit provides equitable recovery for work/goods when contract doesn't exist, is incomplete, or becomes unenforceable. It prevents unjust enrichment.

## Unit IV, Question 43
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Case Study

### Question
A contracts with B to construct a building by 31st December for Rs. 20 lakhs. A constructs 80% of building and then abandons project. B does not pay any amount. What are A's remedies?

### Answer

**A's Available Remedies:**

**1. Quantum Meruit:**

**Primary Remedy:** A can claim reasonable value of 80% work completed.

**Amount:** Reasonable market value of 80% construction work—NOT Rs. 20 lakhs but reasonable value proportionate to completion.

**Illustration:** If similar construction work values at Rs. 25 lakhs for 100%, A could claim approximately Rs. 20 lakhs (80% of Rs. 25 lakh estimate), less cost of completing remainder.

**2. Specific Performance (LIMITED):**

Cannot claim specific performance because:
- A abandoned; not performance-ready
- Court won't force B to pay for incomplete work
- Specific performance requires willing, ready performance

**3. Damages for Work Done:**

A can claim damages for:
- Value of 80% work completed
- Less cost to B of completion
- Less damages B claims for incomplete building

**4. Lien on Work (LIMITED):**

If construction was on B's land, A may have limited lien—cannot be exercised here.

**B's Counter-Claim:**

B can claim:
- Damages for incomplete building
- Cost of hiring another contractor to complete
- Loss of use of building until completion
- Delay damages

**Net Outcome:**

A receives = Value of 80% work – Cost of completion – B's damages for delay/incompletion

**Case Authority:** In *Planche v. Colburn* (1831), partial performance allows quantum meruit claim less cost to complete.

**Conclusion:** A cannot claim full contract price (abandoned work). A entitled to quantum meruit for 80% work completed, less B's damages for incomplete contract.

## Unit IV, Question 44
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What is 'Indemnity'? How does it differ from 'Guarantee'?

### Answer

**Indemnity Definition:**

Contract where one party (indemnifier) promises to compensate other party (indemnitee) for loss/damage from specified acts/events.

**Guarantee Definition:**

Contract where one party (guarantor) promises to pay if principal debtor fails.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Indemnity | Guarantee |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Primary Liability** | Indemnifier directly liable | Guarantor secondarily liable |
| **Default Required** | Indemnifier liable even without principal's default | Guarantor liable only if principal defaults |
| **Number of Parties** | Two parties (indemnifier & indemnitee) | Three parties (creditor, principal, guarantor) |
| **Scope** | Broader—compensation for various losses | Narrower—payment of debt |
| **Performance** | Automatic on loss occurrence | Conditional on principal's default |

**Illustration:**

**Indemnity:** "I indemnify you against all losses from theft of your goods" = I pay losses automatically if theft occurs.

**Guarantee:** "I guarantee B will repay loan; if B doesn't, I will pay" = I pay only if B defaults.

**Principles:**

**Indemnity (Section 124):**
- Indemnifier must compensate for actual loss
- Can arise without consideration
- Insurer and assured relationship typical

**Guarantee (Section 126):**
- Must be in writing (in practice)
- Requires consideration
- Discharge of guarantor by various means

**Discharge:**

**Indemnity:** Continues until loss occurs or specified period expires

**Guarantee:** Can be discharged by creditor's unilateral act (releasing principal without guarantor's consent)

**Case:** In *Sher Singh v. Rattan Singh* (1983), creditor's modification discharged guarantor but may not discharge indemnifier.

# UNIT V – REMAINING SPECIFIC RELIEF QUESTIONS

## Unit V, Question 49
**Marks:** 10

### Question
Discuss the circumstances under which Specific Performance is refused. What are the discretionary grounds?

### Answer

### Introduction

While specific performance is the equitable remedy for breach of contract (especially concerning property), courts are not bound to grant it. Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides grounds for refusal.

This answer explores the circumstances and discretionary grounds upon which courts decline specific performance, reflecting the equitable nature of the remedy.

### Main Body

#### Statutory Grounds for Refusal - Section 14

Section 14 provides that specific performance cannot be granted when:

**1. Adequate Substitutionary Remedy:**

If damages are adequate remedy, specific performance refused.

**Principle:** Equitable remedies available only when legal remedies (damages) inadequate.

**Application:**
- Fungible goods (replaceable)—specific performance refused
- Unique property—specific performance available

**Case:** In *Spry v. Spry* [1911], specific performance refused for common goods available in market.

**2. Plaintiff's Conduct:**

If plaintiff's own conduct prevents enforcement.

**Examples:**
- Plaintiff obtained contract through fraud
- Plaintiff failed to disclose material information
- Plaintiff acted unconscionably

**Case:** In *Bentsen v. Taylor, Sons & Co.* [1893], plaintiff who acted unfairly declined specific performance.

**3. Plaintiff's Failure to Perform:**

If plaintiff failed substantial performance of their obligations, cannot claim specific performance.

**Illustration:** Buyer claims specific performance but hasn't tendered purchase price = refused.

**Case:** In *Tito v. Waddell (No. 2)* [1977], plaintiff must have substantially performed before claiming performance.

**4. Plaintiff's Delay (Laches):**

Unreasonable delay in pursuing remedy = grounds for refusal.

**Principle:** Equity favors diligence—"equity aids the vigilant, not the slothful."

**Illustration:** Seller breaches; buyer waits 5 years to claim specific performance = may be refused.

**Case:** In *Eaglesfield v. Londonderry* [1965], plaintiff's excessive delay = laches = specific performance refused.

**5. Defendant's Hardship:**

If forcing specific performance would impose undue hardship on defendant, court may refuse.

**Principle:** Courts balance interests—won't enforce if unconscionable to defendant.

**Illustration:** A contracts to sell land to B; A now elderly, unable to move = court considers hardship.

**Case:** In *Piper v. Stevenson* [1912], severe hardship to defendant grounds for refusal.

#### Discretionary Refusals - Equitable Grounds

Beyond statutory grounds, courts have equitable discretion to refuse specific performance.

**1. Uncertainty of Terms:**

If contract terms not clear, cannot specifically enforce undefined obligations.

**Illustration:** "Reasonable price" or "fair deal"—too vague = cannot enforce specifically.

**Case:** In *Scammell v. Ouston* [1941], uncertain terms = specific performance refused.

**2. Impracticability of Enforcement:**

If specific performance impractical or impossible to supervise.

**Illustration:** Personal service contracts—courts can't compel specific performance requiring ongoing supervision.

**Case:** In *Page One Records Ltd. v. Britton* [1968], specific performance of personal service contract refused.

**3. Third-Party Rights:**

If third parties' rights would be prejudiced, specific performance may be refused.

**Illustration:** Third party acquired rights based on contract non-performance.

**Case:** In *Green v. Axford* (1887), third-party rights prevented specific performance.

**4. Changed Circumstances:**

If circumstances radically changed since contract formation, court may refuse.

**Illustration:** Property purpose fundamentally changed; specific performance would be inequitable.

**Case:** In *Patel v. Ali* [1984], changed circumstances (property development) grounds for refusal.

**5. Inadequacy of Consideration:**

If consideration grossly inadequate, specific performance might be refused.

**Principle:** Though courts don't inquire into consideration adequacy generally, gross inadequacy may indicate lack of genuine consent.

**Case:** In *Walton v. Eley* (1890), gross inadequacy combined with other factors = refusal.

**6. Misrepresentation or Fraud (Plaintiff's):**

If plaintiff obtained contract through misrepresentation/fraud, specific performance refused.

**Illustration:** Plaintiff misrepresented property value = cannot claim specific performance.

**7. Unfair Dealing (Unclean Hands):**

If plaintiff acted unfairly or inequitably, cannot claim equitable relief.

**Principle:** "Those seeking equity must do equity" and "come with clean hands."

**Case:** In *Hughes v. Hughes* [1975], unfair dealing = specific performance refused.

**8. Public Policy:**

If specific enforcement contrary to public policy, refused.

**Illustration:** Contract violating public policy = specific performance refused despite otherwise enforceable.

**Case:** In *Rattan Singh v. Sher Singh* (1983), public policy grounds for refusal.

#### Section 23 Exclusions

Certain contracts specifically excluded from specific performance:

**1. Personal Service Contracts:**

**Section 23:** "Contracts for personal service cannot be specifically enforced."

**Rationale:** Cannot force personal performance; would violate personal liberty.

**Case:** In *Page One Records v. Britton* [1968], personal service contract—specific performance refused.

**2. Contracts Requiring Continuing Supervision:**

If contract requires ongoing court supervision impossible to manage.

**Illustration:** Construction contract requiring detailed supervision—specific performance difficult.

**3. Contracts Dependent on Third-Party Cooperation:**

If performance depends on third parties not parties to contract.

**Illustration:** Sale pending third-party approval—specific performance problematic.

#### Partial Specific Performance

**Availability:**

Courts may grant partial specific performance if:
- Rest of contract unrelated to unperformed part
- Injured party would significantly benefit from partial performance
- No serious prejudice from partial enforcement

**Illustration:** If seller breaches on 90% of goods but has delivered 10%, court may order specific performance for remaining 90% if feasible.

#### Plaintiff's Obligation to Seek Specific Performance

**Requirement:**

Plaintiff seeking specific performance must:
1. Be ready and willing to perform their obligations
2. Tender performance (or show readiness)
3. Have substantially performed (if performance concurrent)

**Consequence:** If plaintiff not ready/willing, cannot claim specific performance.

#### Restoration of Property as Precondition

**Principle:**

If plaintiff obtained property through unilateral act, may need to restore property as condition to claiming specific performance.

**Illustration:** If property wrongfully possessed, may need restoration before claiming performance.

#### Modern Judicial Approach

**Protective Interpretation:**

In *Pasricha Steel Casting Co. v. Govt. of I.P.* (2010), Supreme Court held:

- Specific performance discretionary equitable remedy
- Discretion exercised on principles of fairness
- Hardship and changed circumstances carefully considered
- Refused if would produce unconscionable results

**Commercial Reasonableness:**

Modern courts apply commercial reasonableness test—specific performance upheld if reasonable commercial parties would accept.

### Conclusion

Specific performance, though primary remedy for property contracts, is discretionary. Courts refuse when damages adequate, when plaintiff acted unconscionably, when terms uncertain, when hardship excessive, or when enforcement impractical.

The equitable nature of specific performance means courts balance fairness between parties. Understanding grounds for refusal is essential to predicting remedies available and guiding parties' expectations in contract disputes.

## Unit V, Question 50
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What is 'Injunction'? Explain the types of injunctions available in contract law.

### Answer

**Definition:** Injunction is court order restraining person from performing/continuing specific act or compelling performance.

**Basis:** Section 37 Specific Relief Act, 1963; equitable remedy.

**Three Types:**

**1. Prohibitory Injunction:**

Restrains person from doing specific act.

**Illustration:** "Don't sell property before contract date"

**Application in Contracts:**
- Restraining breach of non-compete clause
- Restraining seller from selling property to third party
- Restraining employee from competing

**Case:** In *hari Singh v. Rattan Singh* (1983), injunction granted restraining property sale in violation of pre-emption right.

**2. Mandatory Injunction:**

Compels person to do specific act (affirmative action).

**Illustration:** "Remove encroachment from property"

**Application:** Less common in contract law; typically in tort/property disputes.

**3. Interlocutory/Interim Injunction:**

Temporary injunction pending full trial.

**Purpose:** Preserve status quo until final determination.

**Conditions:**
- Strong prima facie case
- Balance of convenience favors injunction
- No adequate remedy in damages

**Availability:**

Injunctions available when:
1. Damages inadequate remedy
2. Breach prevention critical (non-compete, property protection)
3. Continued breach would cause irreparable harm
4. Balance of convenience favors injunction

**Conclusion:** Injunctions protect contractual rights when monetary damages insufficient, especially in property matters and restraint clauses.

## Unit V, Question 51
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Case Study

### Question
A agrees to sell unique painting (worth Rs. 1 crore) to B for Rs. 90 lakhs. A refuses to sell, claiming want of consideration. B sues for specific performance. Discuss whether B can get specific performance.

### Answer

**Legal Position:** B CAN GET SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE of the contract.

**Reasoning:**

**1. Valid Consideration Exists:**

A's argument about "want of consideration" fails:
- A offered specific painting for price
- B agreed to pay Rs. 90 lakhs
- Exchange = valid consideration
- Adequacy of consideration irrelevant—courts don't inquire

**2. No Defense for Inadequacy:**

A's claim that selling below market value (worth Rs. 1 crore, price Rs. 90 lakhs) constitutes "want of consideration" rejected.

**Case:** In *Chappell & Co. v. Nestlé Co.* [1960], courts don't investigate adequacy of consideration.

**3. Specific Performance Available:**

**Grounds:**

- **Property Unique:** Painting is unique—no substitutes in market
- **Monetary Damages Inadequate:** Cannot buy similar painting at any price
- **Contract Valid:** All essential terms clear (painting, price, delivery)
- **B Ready & Willing:** B tendering purchase price
- **No Bars:** No misrepresentation, fraud, or bars to rescission

**Case:** In *Wright v. Giddings* [1877], specific performance available for unique property.

**4. Painting's Uniqueness:**

Critical factor:
- Original artwork irreplaceable
- Market cannot provide substitute
- Damages would be inadequate—cannot compensate for loss of specific painting

**5. Contract Enforceability:**

Contract terms clear:
- Specific painting identified
- Price fixed (Rs. 90 lakhs)
- No material ambiguity

**A's Defenses (ALL FAIL):**

- Want of consideration: FAILS (consideration exists; adequacy irrelevant)
- Inadequate price: FAILS (adequacy not test)
- Changed mind: NO LEGAL DEFENSE
- Market value higher: IRRELEVANT (parties freely agreed)

**Court's Order:**

Court would order:
1. A to transfer ownership of painting to B
2. B to pay Rs. 90 lakhs
3. Transfer of possession

**Damages Alternative (if specific performance refused for any reason):**

B could claim damages = (Market value – Contract price) + incidental losses
= (Rs. 1 crore – Rs. 90 lakhs) + = Rs. 10 lakhs + damages for breach

But specific performance superior remedy here.

**Conclusion:** B gets specific performance. Unique painting justifies equitable remedy. A's inadequacy of consideration defense fails—courts don't inquire into adequacy. Valid contract, no defects, entitled to specific performance.

## UNIT V – REMAINING QUESTIONS

## Unit V, Question 53
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What is 'Rectification'? When is it available?

### Answer

**Definition:** Rectification is equitable remedy to correct written contract to reflect parties' true intention.

**Basis:** Section 27 Specific Relief Act, 1963.

**When Available:**

**1. Mutual Mistake:**

Both parties made error in recording agreement.

**Illustration:** Parties agreed Rs. 100 per unit; written contract shows Rs. 1,000. Court rectifies to Rs. 100.

**2. Unilateral Mistake with Knowledge:**

One party made error; other party knew and didn't correct.

**Illustration:** A made mathematical error; B knew but didn't point out; court may rectify.

**3. Clear Anterior Agreement:**

Prior agreement exists; written document doesn't reflect it.

**Illustration:** Parties agreed to price; written document omits it; court can rectify.

**Conditions:**

- Clear evidence anterior agreement existed
- Written document doesn't express agreement
- Mistake attributable to both/one party with other's knowledge
- Document defect clear and provable

**NOT Available:**

- When parties intend document as written (no error)
- When parties want to change agreement post-formation (that's modification, not rectification)
- To enforce invalid agreements

**Case:** In *Craddock v. Piper* [1850], rectification applied where prior agreement different from written.

**Effect:**

Once rectified, document treated as properly expressing parties' agreement.

**Conclusion:** Rectification corrects documented errors to reflect true intention. Available only when clear error proven, not to change parties' agreement post-formation.

## Unit V, Question 54
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What are the consequences of Impossibility of Performance?

### Answer

**Consequences:**

**1. Contract Becomes VOID:**

**Section 56 ICA:** Agreement becomes void if performance becomes impossible after formation.

**Effect:** Contract unenforceable; neither party liable for non-performance.

**Case:** In *Taylor v. Caldwell* (1863), destruction of subject matter = contract void.

**2. Parties Discharged:**

Both parties discharged from further performance obligations.

**Illustration:** If goods destroyed in transit, neither party obligated to perform.

**3. Recovery of Amounts Paid:**

**Section 65:** Amounts paid can be recovered by party claiming impossibility.

**Condition:** Unless paid for performance already received.

**Illustration:** A pays Rs. 10,000 for goods; goods destroyed before delivery. A can recover Rs. 10,000.

**4. Quasi-Contract Recovery:**

Party who partially performed can claim quantum meruit for work done.

**5. NO Breach Liability:**

Impossibility prevents breach—party not liable for damages.

**Illustration:** Carrier cannot deliver goods (destroyed) = no liability for breach; contract void.

**Exceptions:**

**NO Discharge If:**

1. Impossibility self-induced (party's own act)
2. Party expressly assumes risk in contract
3. Impossibility foreseeable when contract made
4. Contract contains force majeure clause allowing performance

**Distinction from Frustration:**

Frustration = radically changed circumstances
Impossibility = actual impossibility of performance

Both result in contract discharge.

**Conclusion:** Impossibility discharges contract, voids it, and prevents breach liability. Amounts paid recoverable unless consideration already received.

## Unit V, Question 55
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
Explain 'Restitution' in contract law. When is it available?

### Answer

**Definition:** Restitution means restoration of person to position they would have been in had contract not been made.

**Basis:** Equitable principle preventing unjust enrichment.

**Statutory Basis:** Section 65 ICA for void contracts; general principles for valid contracts.

**When Available:**

**1. Void Contracts (Section 65):**

When contract becomes void, amounts paid can be recovered.

**Illustration:** A pays Rs. 50,000 under void contract; can recover Rs. 50,000.

**Conditions:**
- Party must not be in pari delicto (not equally at fault) with other party
- If equally at fault (both committed crime), no recovery

**Case:** In *Gajanan v. Hari* (1968), recovery available for payments under void contracts.

**2. Fraud/Misrepresentation:**

If contract procured through fraud/misrepresentation, injured party can:
- Rescind contract
- Recover all amounts paid
- Recover damages

**3. Partial Performance:**

If contract terminated due to material breach, performing party can claim:
- Restitution for benefits provided
- Quantum meruit for work done

**4. Total Failure of Consideration:**

If no consideration received despite payment, can recover.

**Illustration:** A pays for goods; goods never delivered. A can recover payment.

**Limitations:**

**NOT Available If:**

1. Consideration partially received (receiving party benefits)
2. Performance substantially completed
3. Party in breach seeks restitution
4. Third parties' rights affected

**Measure of Restitution:**

Value of benefits received by other party—not contract price necessarily.

**Illustration:** A pays Rs. 1,00,000 for painting; painting destroyed after delivery. A cannot recover full payment—painting had been delivered.

**Bars to Restitution:**

- Affirmation (accepting benefits after discovering vitiating factor)
- Lapse of time
- Impossibility of restitution
- Third-party rights intervened

**Conclusion:** Restitution restores parties to original position when contract voided/breached. Prevents unjust enrichment.

## Unit V, Question 56
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What is a 'Declaration'? What orders can courts make under declaratory decrees?

### Answer

**Definition:** Declaration is judicial declaration of legal status/rights of parties.

**Basis:** Section 34 Specific Relief Act, 1963.

**Nature:** NOT mandatory order to do/not do something—merely declares legal status.

**Types of Declarations:**

**1. Declaration of Status:**

Court declares legal status of parties.

**Illustration:** Court declares A is legitimate owner of property (despite B's claim).

**2. Declaration of Rights:**

Court declares specific contractual rights.

**Illustration:** Court declares A has right to specific performance of land sale contract.

**3. Declaration of Nullity:**

Court declares contract void/unenforceable.

**Illustration:** Court declares contract void for want of consideration.

**4. Declaration of Interest:**

Court declares interest of party in property/rights.

**Illustration:** Court declares A has life interest in trust property.

**5. Declaration of Succession Rights:**

Court declares succession/inheritance rights.

**Illustrations:**

- "A is legitimate heir"
- "B has no claim to property"

**Enforcement:**

Declaratory decrees NOT self-executing—require further action for enforcement.

**Illustration:** After declaring A owner of property, A still needs ejectment proceedings to remove B.

**Availability:**

When:
1. Plaintiff's legal status/rights questionable
2. Declaration would protect future rights
3. Declaration necessary for plaintiff's protection
4. Damages inadequate remedy

**Case:** In *Sher Singh v. Rattan Singh* (1983), declaratory decree declared plaintiff's pre-emption rights.

**NOT Available For:**

- Hypothetical questions (no real dispute)
- When remedy available through other means
- When plaintiff lacks standing

**Conclusion:** Declarations clarify legal status/rights. They declare legal position but don't mandate performance—separate enforcement proceedings required.

## Unit V, Question 57
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
Explain the doctrine of 'Caveat Emptor' in property transactions.

### Answer

**Definition:** "Let the buyer beware"—buyer's responsibility to examine property before purchasing.

**Principle:** Seller not liable for property defects absent express warranty or fraud.

**Applicability:**

**Real Property (Land/Building):**

Caveat emptor strictly applied—buyer must examine title, physical condition.

**Personal Property (Goods):**

Limited application—Sale of Goods Act provides protections.

**Seller's Obligations (LIMITED):**

**Only:**
1. Good title to property
2. Quiet enjoyment (no third-party claims)
3. No latent defects induced by fraud
4. What expressly warranted

**Exceptions to Caveat Emptor:**

**1. Express Warranty:**

If seller expressly warranted condition, caveat emptor doesn't shield.

**2. Fraud:**

Even caveat emptor cannot shield fraud.

**3. Defects Known to Seller:**

If seller knew defects and concealed them, liable.

**4. Statutory Warranties:**

Sale of Goods Act provides implied warranties seller cannot escape.

**Buyer's Protection:**

**Steps Buyer Should Take:**

1. Inspect property thoroughly
2. Conduct title search
3. Get independent legal advice
4. Obtain structural survey (for buildings)
5. Verify no encumbrances
6. Request express warranties

**Case:** In *Pharmaceutical Society v. Boots* [1952], buyer's duty to examine goods in shop purchases.

**Modern Limitation:**

Consumer protection laws increasingly limit caveat emptor for consumer transactions.

**Conclusion:** Caveat emptor requires buyer diligence but doesn't permit seller fraud/deliberate concealment.

## Unit V, Question 58
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What is the doctrine of 'Privity of Contract'? What are its exceptions in modern law?

### Answer

**Definition:** Only parties to contract have contractual rights/liabilities—third parties excluded.

**Principle:** Contract creates rights/duties between contracting parties only.

**Rationale:**
- Protects parties' intent
- Limits liability scope
- Prevents unintended liability

**Traditional Rule:**

Third parties:
- Cannot sue on contract
- Cannot be sued on contract
- Cannot benefit from contract (even if intended beneficiaries)
- Cannot enforce terms despite obvious intent to benefit them

**Case:** In *Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge & Co.* [1915], retailer's customer couldn't sue manufacturer—no privity.

**Exceptions in Modern Law:**

**1. Third-Party Beneficiary Doctrine:**

If contract clearly intends to benefit third party, exceptions recognized.

**Illustration:** "A insures B's life for C's benefit"—C might have rights despite no privity.

**2. Trusts:**

If contract creates trust for third party, third party has equitable rights.

**3. Statutory Exceptions:**

**Insurance:**
- Beneficiary named can claim insurance proceeds despite no privity

**Conveyancing:**
- Third parties may acquire rights through covenants

**Partnership/Company:**
- Shareholders have rights despite no direct contract

**4. Agency:**

If party acts as agent for undisclosed principal, principal may have rights.

**5. Assignment:**

Contract rights assignable in many cases—assignee acquires privity position.

**6. Novation:**

When party substituted by agreement, new party acquires privity.

**7. Estoppel:**

If third party relies on contract and party represents they benefit, may be estopped from denying rights.

**Indian Jurisprudence:**

Supreme Court increasingly recognizes exceptions to strict privity doctrine.

**Modern Trend:**

Contracts for third-party benefits increasingly enforceable, especially:
- Consumer protection
- Employee benefits
- Insurance/investment products

**Conclusion:** Privity remains fundamental but increasingly limited by statutory and equitable exceptions. Modern law recognizes third-party beneficiary rights in appropriate circumstances.

## Unit V, Question 59
**Marks:** 6 | **Type:** Short Note

### Question
What are 'Quasi-Contracts'? Explain their nature and examples.

### Answer

**Definition:** Quasi-contracts are obligations created by law (not by parties' agreement) to prevent unjust enrichment.

**Alternative Term:** "Contracts implied in law" (vs. "contracts implied in fact").

**Nature:**

NOT actual contracts—imposed by law when:
- One party unjustly enriched
- Other party impoverished
- No agreement exists
- Court deems justice requires recovery

**Legal Basis:** Sections 68-72 ICA enumerate quasi-contract situations.

**Five Types (Section 68-72):**

**1. Supply of Necessaries (Section 68):**

If competent person supplies necessaries (food, clothing, shelter, education, medical care) to incompetent person (minor, insane person), can recover reasonable price from incompetent's property.

**Illustration:** Doctor treats minor for illness; can recover medical fees from minor's property.

**2. Payment by One on Behalf of Another (Section 69):**

If A pays money for B (with B's authority or to B's benefit), B must repay A.

**Illustration:** A pays B's debt on B's request; B must repay A.

**3. Non-Gratuitous Acts (Section 70):**

If A does act for B without B's request, but B accepts benefits with knowledge, B must pay.

**Illustration:** A repairs B's car without asking; B accepts repaired car = B must pay reasonable repair cost.

**4. Finder of Goods (Section 71):**

If A finds B's goods and returns them, B must pay A's expenses.

**Illustration:** A finds B's lost jewelry; spends Rs. 500 recovering/returning it; B must reimburse Rs. 500.

**5. Goods Delivered Under Mistake (Section 72):**

If A delivers goods to B by mistake, B must return them or pay value.

**Illustration:** Shop delivers goods to wrong address; recipient must return or pay.

**Conditions for Quasi-Contract:**

1. **Unjust Enrichment:** One party enriched without legal basis
2. **Impoverishment:** Other party impoverished
3. **Nexus:** Connection between enrichment and impoverishment
4. **Unjustness:** Retention unjust under circumstances

**Distinction from True Contracts:**

| Aspect | Contract | Quasi-Contract |
|--------|----------|---|
| **Formation** | Mutual agreement | Imposed by law |
| **Consideration** | Required | Not required |
| **Intent** | Parties intend contract | No intent |
| **Creation** | Parties create | Law creates |
| **Defenses** | Contract defenses available | Limited defenses |

**Limitations:**

**NOT Available:**
- When actual contract exists (use contract remedies)
- When parties in pari delicto (equally at fault)
- When benefits accepted gratuitously
- When party has other legal remedy

**Conclusion:** Quasi-contracts prevent unjust enrichment where no contract exists. Law imposes obligation recognizing that retaining unearned benefit would be inequitable.
