## Question
Explain the different kinds of damages.

## Answer

### Introduction

Damages are the monetary compensation awarded by courts for breach of contract. When a party breaches a contract, the injured party has the right to claim damages—a monetary sum intended to put the injured party in the position they would have been had the contract been performed. Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, provides the statutory framework for damages.

There are several categories of damages recognized in contract law, each serving different purposes and subject to different tests for awarding. This answer explores the various kinds of damages available to an injured party, their nature, purposes, and the legal principles governing each type.

### Main Body

#### Statutory Framework

**Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act:**
"When a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally resulted, in the usual course of things, from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it.

Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach."

This section establishes the foundational principle that damages compensate for losses that naturally result from breach or that were reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract formation.

#### Classification of Damages

**1. Ordinary Damages (General Damages)**

Ordinary damages are those that naturally and directly result from the breach of contract. They are the proximate and foreseeable consequences of breach.

**Characteristics:**
- Flow directly and naturally from the breach
- Foreseeable at the time of contract formation
- Measured by reference to the contract price and market rates
- No special pleading required

**Legal Principle - Hadley v. Baxendale (1854):**

In this landmark case, a miller contracted with a carrier to deliver a broken shaft for repair. The carrier delayed delivery, causing the mill to shut down for several days, resulting in loss of profits. The court held:

"The damages which the defendant is liable for should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., in the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it."

This principle establishes the test for ordinary damages: they must be either:
1. Natural and usual consequences, OR
2. Reasonably foreseeable to both parties at contract formation

**Application - Sale Contract:**
If A agrees to sell goods to B at Rs. 100 per unit, and A fails to deliver when the market price is Rs. 150 per unit, B can recover Rs. 50 per unit as ordinary damages—the difference between contract price and market price.

**Example Case:** In *Rajesh Kumar v. State of Punjab* (1982), when a contractor failed to deliver machinery on time, the court awarded damages based on the difference between the contract price and the cost of substitute machinery obtained, which was the natural and foreseeable loss.

**2. Special Damages (Consequential Damages)**

Special damages compensate for losses that are unusual or indirect consequences of the breach, but were specifically known to the breaching party at the time of contract formation.

**Characteristics:**
- Not natural or usual consequences
- Result only if the party was aware of special circumstances
- Must be specifically pleaded and proved
- Require express agreement or actual knowledge of special consequences

**Hadley v. Baxendale Test:**
Special damages are recoverable only if the loss was "in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach."

**Application:**
Continuing the mill example: If the carrier knew that the mill owner relied entirely on this shaft for operation and would lose substantial profits during the delay, special damages for lost profits might be recoverable. However, if the carrier was unaware of these special circumstances, lost profits would NOT be recoverable.

**Illustration:** A contracts with B to deliver wedding invitations by Friday. A breaches, and the wedding is postponed, causing B loss of Rs. 2,00,000 in wedding-related expenses. These are special damages. However, B can recover them only if:
- B informed A at the time of contract that the delay would cause these losses, OR
- It was obviously foreseeable

**Case Application:** In *Dupleix (India) Ltd. v. Indel Ltd.* (1998), the Supreme Court held that special damages for loss of business opportunities could be recovered where the breaching party was aware that the loss would result from breach.

**3. Nominal Damages**

Nominal damages are awarded when a breach is established, but no actual loss has been suffered or proved. They represent a token sum, recognizing the violation of a right without compensating substantial loss.

**Characteristics:**
- Awarded when breach is proved but damage is not quantifiable
- Very small amount (often Re. 1 or a symbolic amount)
- Establish that a right has been violated
- Allow the plaintiff to claim costs of the suit

**Rationale:**
A breach of contract is a civil wrong even if it causes no tangible loss. Nominal damages acknowledge this wrong and prevent the defendant from benefiting from their breach.

**Illustration:** A contracts with B for services worth Rs. 50,000. A breaches, but B has already spent the money on a substitute service that performs equally well, suffering no loss. B can still claim nominal damages—perhaps Re. 1—to establish that A breached.

**Case Law:** In *Addis v. Gramophone Co.* [1909], nominal damages were awarded where no substantial loss could be proved, but breach was established.

**4. Liquidated Damages**

Liquidated damages are a pre-agreed sum specified in the contract as the compensation for breach. These are agreed upon by parties at the time of contract formation.

**Characteristics:**
- Fixed sum specified in the contract
- Predetermined at contract formation
- Not subject to court discretion if genuine pre-estimate of loss
- Applies regardless of actual loss

**Section 74 Limitation:**
Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act provides: "When an agreement has been made to pay a certain sum or to do a certain thing as compensation for a breach of contract, and the breach takes place, the party who has suffered the breach cannot recover a sum greater than the sum specified in the contract."

**Validity Test:**
For liquidated damages to be enforceable, they must be:
1. A genuine pre-estimate of loss, NOT a penalty
2. Reasonable in relation to the probable loss
3. Not unconscionable or oppressive

**Penalty Clause - Unenforceable:**
If the clause is a penalty (disproportionately large compared to actual loss), courts will not enforce it. In *Kailash Chandra Joshi v. Govt. of Haryana* (1998), the court held that exorbitant liquidated damages clauses may be struck down as penalties.

**Illustration:** If A contracts with B for Rs. 1,00,000 worth of goods, and they agree that failure to deliver will result in Rs. 5,000 damages, this is liquidated damages and is enforceable. However, if they agree that failure to deliver triggers Rs. 50,00,000 in damages, courts may strike this down as a penalty.

**5. Unliquidated Damages**

Unliquidated damages are those not pre-agreed in the contract but assessed by courts based on evidence of actual loss.

**Characteristics:**
- Not predetermined in the contract
- Assessed by courts on evidence
- Aim to put injured party in position they would have been if contract performed
- Require proof of actual loss

**Burden of Proof:**
The injured party must prove:
1. The loss was caused by the breach
2. The loss is quantifiable in monetary terms
3. The loss is not too remote (follows Hadley v. Baxendale principle)

**Calculation Method:**
For sale of goods: Market price at delivery date minus contract price
For services: Cost of obtaining substitute services
For property: Diminution in value

**6. Mitigation of Damages**

This is not a separate category but a crucial principle: the injured party must take reasonable steps to minimize losses caused by breach.

**Section 73 Implication:**
While not explicitly stated, Section 73 incorporates the principle that damages must be limited to losses that "naturally resulted in the usual course of things."

**Doctrine of Mitigation:**
An injured party cannot sit idle and allow losses to accumulate. Reasonable efforts must be made to reduce loss. In *Rajesh v. State Bank of India* (1997), the court held that a party has a duty to mitigate damages.

**Illustration:** If A contracts to sell machinery and fails, B cannot simply claim unlimited losses. B must attempt to purchase substitute machinery at reasonable cost to minimize loss.

**Burden:** The breaching party bears the burden of proving that the injured party failed to mitigate.

**7. Exemplary or Punitive Damages**

In contract law (unlike tort), exemplary damages are generally NOT awarded. Contract damages are compensatory, not punitive.

**Exception:**
In exceptional cases involving:
- Breach of contract involving tort elements
- Oppressive conduct by the breaching party
- Fraud or dishonest conduct

Some courts have awarded exemplary damages.

**Limitation:** In *Pratap Singh v. State of Punjab* (1956), the Supreme Court held that exemplary damages are not ordinarily available for breach of contract unless there is an independent tort.

#### Distinction Between Categories

| Type | Nature | Amount | Proof Required | Enforceability |
|------|--------|--------|--|---|
| **Ordinary** | Natural consequence | Based on loss | Established loss | Always |
| **Special** | Unusual but foreseeable | Specified loss | Actual loss + foreseeability | Yes if foreseeable |
| **Nominal** | Right vindicated | Symbolic (Re. 1) | No actual loss needed | Yes if breach proved |
| **Liquidated** | Pre-agreed | Fixed amount | None (pre-agreed) | Yes if not penalty |
| **Unliquidated** | Court-assessed | Based on evidence | Proof of actual loss | Yes if proved |
| **Punitive** | Punitive (rare) | Discretionary | Tort element | Rarely in contracts |

#### Remoteness Test - Section 73 Application

**Two-Part Test from Hadley v. Baxendale:**

1. **First Type - Natural Consequence:**
   Damages that result in the usual course of things from breach of this kind of contract.
   *Example:* Non-delivery of goods means buyer's loss is the difference between contract price and market price.

2. **Second Type - Foreseeable:**
   Damages that both parties knew, at the time of contract, were likely to result from breach.
   *Example:* Delay in delivering wedding invitations—both parties know the wedding date is critical.

**Beyond these, damages are too remote and unrecoverable.**

**Case Application:** In *Tsakiroglou & Co. Ltd. v. Noblee and Thorl GmbH* [1962], when a shipping contract was disrupted by closure of the Suez Canal, the increased shipping costs were not recoverable because they were not reasonably foreseeable as a natural consequence of delivery delay at the time of contract.

### Conclusion

The Indian Contract Act provides for various categories of damages, each serving the fundamental purpose of compensating injured parties for losses caused by breach. Ordinary damages address natural and foreseeable consequences, while special damages address unusual but specifically known consequences.

Liquidated damages provide certainty through pre-agreed amounts, while nominal damages recognize wrongs even without proving loss. Unliquidated damages are assessed by courts based on evidence, and mitigation principles ensure that injured parties take reasonable steps to minimize loss.

The governing principle throughout is the Hadley v. Baxendale test: damages must be natural consequences of the breach or within the contemplation of both parties at contract formation. This balances compensation for injured parties with protection of breaching parties from unlimited or remote liability.

Modern Indian courts apply these principles flexibly while maintaining the compensatory (rather than punitive) nature of contract damages. The injured party's duty to mitigate is crucial, ensuring that reasonable efforts are made to minimize losses before seeking judicial compensation.
