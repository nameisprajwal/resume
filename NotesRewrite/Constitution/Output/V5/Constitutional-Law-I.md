## 1.2. Introduction to the Constitution

A constitution is the fundamental and supreme law of a country that establishes the basic framework for governance and defines the relationship between the state and its citizens. It serves as the foundational document that outlines the structure, powers, and functions of government institutions while guaranteeing fundamental rights to the people. The constitution acts as the supreme law of the land, meaning all other laws must conform to its provisions and cannot contradict its principles. It establishes the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government to prevent the abuse of authority and ensure checks and balances. A constitution typically includes a preamble that states the fundamental principles and aspirations of the nation, followed by provisions on government structure, citizens' rights, and amendment procedures. Most constitutions are written documents that are deliberately drafted and adopted through a formal process, though some countries like the United Kingdom have unwritten constitutions based on traditions and conventions.

The constitution provides legitimacy to the government by establishing clear rules about how political power is acquired, exercised, and transferred in society. It serves as a social contract between the rulers and the ruled, ensuring that government power is exercised for the public good rather than personal benefit. Constitutional provisions are typically more difficult to amend than ordinary laws, requiring special procedures like supermajorities or referendums to maintain stability and protect core principles. In essence, a constitution creates the legal foundation for democracy, the rule of law, and constitutional governance that protects both individual freedoms and collective interests.

The Constitution of India is the country's supreme law, establishing the fundamental principles, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions, as well as the fundamental rights, directive principles, and duties of citizens. It serves as the foundational framework for the governance of India by:

* Defining the political code, organization, and powers of the state.
* Outlining limitations of government authority.
* Guaranteeing rights, justice, equality, liberty, and fraternity to all citizens.
* Acting as the legal basis from which all laws and practices must derive validity.

The Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950, marking the transformation of India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. It cannot be overridden by the Parliament and establishes a system of checks and balances through separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Indian Constitution is also notable for being the world's longest written constitution, carefully detailing the rights of citizens and the structure of governance.

The constitution is a written instrument embodying the rules of a political and social organization, and guarantees certain rights to the people in it. It is the fundamental law, written or unwritten, that establishes the character of a government by defining the basic principles to which a society must conform; by describing the organization of the government and its regulation.

# 3. Constitutionalism

Besides the concept of the Constitution, there is also the all-important concept of **Constitutionalism**. Modern political thought draws a distinction between Constitutionalism and Constitution. A country may have a Constitution but not necessarily Constitutionalism. For example, a country with a dictatorship, where the dictator’s word is law, can be said to have a Constitution but not Constitutionalism.

The underlying difference between the two concepts is that a Constitution ought not merely to confer powers on the various organs of the government, but also seek to restrain those powers. Constitutionalism recognizes the need for government but insists upon limitations being placed upon governmental powers. Constitutionalism envisages checks and balances and putting the powers of the legislature and the executive under some restraints, not making them uncontrolled and arbitrary. Unlimited powers jeopardize the freedom of the people. As has been well said: **power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.** If the Constitution confers unrestrained power on either the legislature or the executive, it might lead to an authoritarian, oppressive government.

Therefore, to preserve the basic freedoms of the individual and to maintain his dignity and personality, the Constitution should be permeated with Constitutionalism; it should have some in-built restrictions on the powers conferred by it on governmental organs. **Constitutionalism** connotes in essence **limited government** or a limitation on government. Constitutionalism is the antithesis of arbitrary powers. Constitutionalism recognizes the need for government with powers but at the same time insists that limitations be placed on those powers. The antithesis of Constitutionalism is despotism. Unlimited power may lead to an authoritarian, oppressive government which jeopardizes the freedoms of the people.

Only when the Constitution of a country seeks to decentralize power instead of concentrating it at one point, and also imposes other restraints and limitations thereon, does a country have not only a constitution but also constitutionalism. **Constitutions spring from a belief in limited government**. According to SCHWARTZ, in the U.S.A., the word **Constitution** means *“a written organic instrument, under which governmental powers are both conferred and circumscribed.”* He emphasizes that *“this stress upon grant and limitation of authority is fundamental.”*

A written Constitution, independent judiciary with powers of judicial review, the doctrine of rule of law and separation of powers, free elections to the legislature, accountable and transparent democratic government, Fundamental Rights of the people, federalism, and decentralization of power are some of the principles and norms which promote Constitutionalism in a country.

# 5. The Preamble

The Preamble to the Constitution of India stands as the most significant introductory statement that encapsulates the philosophy, objectives, and fundamental values upon which the entire constitutional framework rests. Often described by eminent jurists as the **"identity card"** and **"soul"** of the Constitution, it provides both historical context and interpretive guidance for India's democratic governance.

## 5.1. Historical Background and Origin

The Preamble finds its roots in **Jawaharlal Nehru's Objectives Resolution**, presented to the Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946, and adopted on January 22, 1947. This resolution laid down the fundamental principles and aspirations that would guide the Constitution-making process. The Preamble was the first part to be introduced and the last to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly, demonstrating the careful deliberation that went into its formulation.

The Constituent Assembly engaged in extensive debates on October 17, 1949, discussing various aspects, including the name of India and the inclusion of religious references. After thorough consideration, the Preamble was finally adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950 – Republic Day.

## 5.2. Text and Components of the Preamble

"WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a **SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC** and to secure to all its citizens:
**JUSTICE**, social, economic and political;
**LIBERTY** of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
**EQUALITY** of status and of opportunity;
and to promote among them all
**FRATERNITY** assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;
IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY **ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION**."

## 5.3. Analysis of Key Components

### 5.3.1. Source of Authority: "WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA"
* Establishes popular sovereignty – the ultimate authority derives from the people.
* Reflects the democratic foundation where the Constitution is "a power of attorney given by the people, not a charter given by power."
* Emphasizes unity in diversity by referring to all Indians collectively despite their varied backgrounds.

### 5.3.2. Nature of the Indian State
* **Sovereign:** India possesses complete independence and authority, free from external control.
* **Socialist:** Added by the 42nd Amendment (1976), it signifies the state's commitment to economic and social democracy, mixed economy, and welfare state principles.
* **Secular:** Also added by the 42nd Amendment, it ensures equal respect and protection for all religions, with the state maintaining neutrality in religious matters.
* **Democratic:** Establishes a system where authority flows from the people through elected representatives.
* **Republic:** Ensures that the head of state (President) is elected, not hereditary.

### 5.3.3. Fundamental Objectives: Justice, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity

**A. Justice (Social, Economic, and Political):**
* **Social Justice:** Equal treatment and opportunities regardless of background.
* **Economic Justice:** Fair distribution of resources and equal pay for equal work.
* **Political Justice:** Equal political rights and participation in governance.

**B. Liberty (of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship):**
* Guarantees fundamental freedoms while ensuring they do not infringe on others' rights.
* It is not absolute liberty but qualified liberty within constitutional limitations.

**C. Equality (of status and opportunity):**
* **Civic Equality:** Through fundamental rights (Articles 14–18).
* **Political Equality:** Through universal adult franchise (Articles 325–326).
* **Economic Equality:** Through Directive Principles promoting equal opportunities.

**D. Fraternity (assuring dignity of individual and unity and integrity of the Nation):**
* Promotes brotherhood and national integration.
* Addresses challenges like communalism, regionalism, and linguism.
* Originally stated "unity of the nation," changed to "unity and integrity of the nation" by the 42nd Amendment.

## 5.4. The 42nd Amendment and Its Impact

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976, enacted during the Emergency period, made significant changes to the Preamble.

**A. Words Added:**
* **"Socialist"** – reflecting commitment to socio-economic equality.
* **"Secular"** – emphasizing religious neutrality.
* **"Integrity"** – changing "unity of the nation" to "unity and integrity of the nation."

This amendment, often called the **"Mini-Constitution,"** was controversial due to its timing during Emergency but has been constitutionally validated.

## 5.5. Legal Status and Judicial Interpretation

### 5.5.1. Evolution of Judicial Understanding

* **Berubari Union Case (1960):** Initially held that the Preamble was not part of the Constitution. Described it as *“a key to open the mind of the makers”* but not enforceable.
* **Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973):** Landmark reversal – declared the Preamble as an **integral part** of the Constitution. Established it as essential for constitutional interpretation under the **Basic Structure Doctrine**. Confirmed that while not a source of substantive powers, it guides interpretation.
* **Recent Judicial Affirmation (2024):** In *Dr. Balram Singh vs Union of India*, the Supreme Court dismissed challenges to "socialist" and "secular" additions, reaffirming their constitutional validity.

## 5.6. Significance and Functions

### 5.6.1. Core Functions
1.  **Interpretative Guide:** Serves as the *“guiding light”* for interpreting constitutional provisions, resolving ambiguities in constitutional language, and providing context for fundamental rights and directive principles.
2.  **Constitutional Identity:** Defines the essential character and philosophy of the Indian state. Reflects the *“political horoscope”* of the nation (K.M. Munshi).
3.  **Basic Structure Protection:** Core elements of the Preamble are protected under the Basic Structure Doctrine. Cannot be amended in ways that destroy its fundamental character.
4.  **Moral and Philosophical Foundation:** Embodies the aspirations of the freedom struggle and provides a moral compass for governance and policy-making.
5.  **Unity in Diversity:** Promotes national integration across diverse communities and emphasizes common citizenship and shared values.

## 5.7. Amendability of the Preamble

The Supreme Court in *Kesavananda Bharati* established that:
* The Preamble can be amended under Article 368.
* Such amendments are subject to basic structure limitations.
* The amendment power extends to the Preamble but cannot destroy its essential features.

The 42nd Amendment serves as a precedent that the Preamble is amendable, provided the basic structure remains intact.

## 5.8. Contemporary Relevance
* A benchmark for constitutional interpretation in modern jurisprudence.
* A symbol of India's constitutional values in an evolving democracy.
* A framework for policy evaluation, ensuring alignment with constitutional principles.
* A source of national identity that transcends political divisions.

## 5.9. Conclusion

The Preamble to the Indian Constitution represents far more than a mere introduction – it is the philosophical foundation upon which Indian democracy stands. As the "soul and key to the Constitution," it embodies the collective aspirations of the Indian people for justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. Its evolution through the 42nd Amendment and continued judicial protection under the Basic Structure Doctrine demonstrates its dynamic yet enduring character. The Preamble's significance lies not just in its historical importance but in its continuing role as the moral compass that guides India's constitutional journey. It remains a testament to the vision of the Constitution-makers and serves as an eternal reminder of the ideals that the Indian nation strives to achieve. In the words of Nehru, it represents *"a firm resolution and a solid promise"* – a commitment that continues to shape India's democratic destiny.

# 6. Scope of the Preamble

1.  The Preamble of the Indian Constitution is the introductory statement that enunciates the source, nature, and objectives of the Constitution, reflecting the collective will of **“We, the People of India.”**
2.  In the **Berubari Union case (1960)**, the Supreme Court held that the Preamble was not an enforceable part of the Constitution and could not confer powers or rights, but served as a *"key to open the minds of the makers."*
3.  The landmark **Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)** overruled Berubari, declaring the Preamble to be an **integral part** of the Constitution and a component of its **"basic structure,"** thereby permitting its use in constitutional interpretation but precluding any amendment that would destroy its essential features.
4.  In ***Union of India v. LIC* (1995)**, the Court reaffirmed *Kesavananda* by holding that the Preamble is part of the Constitution, emphasizing its role as the *"heart and soul"* that guides the understanding of all substantive provisions.
5.  The Preamble’s amendability was settled in *Kesavananda*: it can be amended under Article 368, but such amendments must respect the Constitution’s Basic Structure Doctrine and cannot obliterate the Preamble’s core values.
6.  In ***S.R. Bommai v. Union of India* (1994)**, the Supreme Court invoked the Preamble’s terms—especially secularism—to hold that **secularism is part of the basic structure**, thereby invalidating state actions that subverted religious neutrality.
7.  Functionally, the Preamble serves as an interpretative guide: when constitutional provisions are ambiguous, courts refer to the Preamble to ascertain the framers’ intent and the overarching constitutional philosophy.
8.  While not a source of substantive rights, the Preamble helps harmonize fundamental rights with Directive Principles by underscoring objectives such as justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.
9.  The Preamble also anchors the amendment process, as seen in the **42nd Amendment (1976)**, which inserted the words *“Socialist,” “Secular,”* and *“Integrity,”* thereby altering the Preamble’s textual statement of national ideals but within the permissible limits of basic structure.
10. In sum, the scope of the Preamble in India encompasses its function as a declaratory preface, an interpretative tool, and a protected core of the Constitution that delineates its fundamental values and limits the legislature’s power to amend those values.

# 7. Importance of the Preamble

The Preamble to the Indian Constitution is far more than a mere introductory statement; it embodies the philosophical foundation, objectives, and basic values driving the constitutional framework. Its importance can be understood under the following headings:

1.  **Source of Sovereignty:** “We, the People of India” declares popular sovereignty, affirming that all authority flows from citizens rather than any monarch or legislature.
2.  **Expression of Constitutional Philosophy:** It succinctly states the nation’s core ideals—justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity—providing the moral compass for governance.
3.  **Declaratory Preface:** As a declaratory preface, the Preamble outlines the aims and objectives of the Constitution, guiding the interpretation of detailed provisions.
4.  **Interpretative Tool:** Courts use the Preamble as a “guiding light” when constitutional text is ambiguous, ensuring that legislative and executive actions align with foundational goals.
5.  **Integral Part of the Constitution:** In *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973), the Supreme Court held that the Preamble is part of the Constitution’s basic structure, making it inviolable by amendment.
6.  **Limitation on Amendment Power:** While amendable under Article 368, any change must respect the Preamble’s essential features, safeguarding its core principles from legislative override.
7.  **Harmonizing Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles:** The Preamble balances justiciable rights with non-justiciable Directive Principles, guiding the state to promote welfare without undermining individual freedoms.
8.  **Judicial Recognition of Enforceability:** In *Union of India v. LIC* (1995), the Court reaffirmed the Preamble’s status as part of the Constitution, describing it as the “heart and soul” of the document.
9.  **Protection of Secularism:** Through cases like *S.R. Bommai v. Union of India* (1994), the Court invoked the Preamble’s secularism clause to invalidate state actions violating religious neutrality.
10. **Reflection of Historical Aspirations:** Originating from Nehru’s Objectives Resolution (1946), the Preamble captures the freedom struggle’s aspirations, linking modern governance to India’s path to independence.
11. **Definition of State Character:** Terms such as “Sovereign,” “Socialist,” “Secular,” “Democratic,” and “Republic” specify the nature of the Indian state and its governance model.
12. **Framework for National Unity:** By promising fraternity and integrity, it promotes national integration and counters divisive forces like regionalism and communalism.
13. **Guideline for Policy Formulation:** Legislatures and executives refer to the Preamble to ensure that laws and policies advance constitutional objectives, especially in welfare and social justice measures.
14. **Symbol of Constitutional Identity:** Often called the “Identity Card” or “Political Horoscope” of the Constitution, it uniquely identifies India’s constitutional ethos.
15. **Basis for Basic Structure Doctrine:** The Preamble underpins the Supreme Court’s Basic Structure Doctrine, which limits constitutional amendments that alter foundational principles.
16. **Moral Force in Governance:** While not providing substantive rights, its aspirational language exerts moral pressure on state organs and society to uphold democratic values.
17. **Check on Majoritarianism:** By enshrining fundamental values above transient majorities, it serves as a constitutional check against populist or authoritarian measures.
18. **Educational Function:** As an accessible summary of constitutional goals, it educates citizens about their rights and duties, fostering civic awareness and participation.
19. **Historical Record of Constitutional Evolution:** The **42nd Amendment (1976)**—which added *“Socialist,” “Secular,”* and *“Integrity”*—demonstrates the Preamble’s adaptability within the basic structure.
20. **Eternal Guiding Light:** In the words of the Supreme Court, the Preamble remains the *“soul and key”* of the Constitution, continuously guiding its interpretation and evolution in India’s democratic journey.

## 7.21. Conclusion on Importance

The Preamble’s importance lies in its dual role as both a declaratory preface and an interpretative guide that safeguards the Constitution’s core values. Recognized by landmark judgments as an integral part of the basic structure, it both empowers and constrains the state while offering a timeless vision of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for the Indian polity.

# 8. Objectives and Values Enshrined in the Preamble

## 9. Constitutional Amendment and "Law" (Article 13 vs. Article 368)

The question of whether the word **“law”** in clause (2) of **Article 13** also includes a **‘Constitutional amendment’** was for the first time considered by the Supreme Court in ***Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India***. The Constitutional (1st Amendment) Act, 1951, which amended the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution, was challenged on the ground that since the amendment had the effect of abridging the Fundamental Rights, it was not a valid law within the meaning of clause (2) of Article 13.

The contention was rejected by the Apex Court, which held that the word ‘law’ in clause (2) did not include a law made by the Parliament under Article 368 amending the Constitution. It was stated that the word ‘law’ means the *“rules and regulations enacted by legislatures”* and not the *“constitutional amendments made in exercise of constituent powers.”*

Therefore, this judgment was followed by a majority of judgments, such as in ***Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan***. However, in the case... *(Original source text is incomplete here.)*

# 10. Fundamental Duties (Continuation of Unit I Topic)

### 10.1. Right to Work and Duties

The lack of a specific provision for the **“right to work”** in the Indian Constitution is still a gap today. The "right to work" should, therefore, be guaranteed to every citizen who is expected to do certain duties to the nation.

### 10.2. Enforcement of Duties

The fundamental duties are statutory duties and shall be enforceable by Law. Parliament, by law, may provide penalties to be imposed for failure to fulfil those duties and obligations. The success of this provision would, however, depend much upon the manner in which and the person against whom these duties would be enforced and for its proper enforcement it is necessary that it should be known to all.

In ***AIIMS Students Union v. AIIMS*** **(1983) 1 SCC 471**, it was held that Fundamental Duties, though not enforceable by writ of the court, yet provide a valuable guide and aid to the interpretation of constitutional and legal issues.

### 10.3. Criticism of Fundamental Duties

* **Vague and Complex Terms:** Some of the duties are vague, and the terms used therein are complex, which even a highly educated person would find difficult to grasp, such as identifying the noble ideas that inspired our national struggle for freedom.
* **Clash with Religious Principles:** Some of the duties clash with religious principles of some religious sects in the country. In one Judgment, the Supreme Court held that no person can be forced to join the singing of the National Anthem if he has genuine religious obligations which place religious belief above patriotism.
* **Lack of Specific Sanction:** There is no specific provision nor any sanction as to the implementation and enforcement of Fundamental Duties.
