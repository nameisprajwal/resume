# 1. UNIT I: INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION

The Constitution of India is the country's supreme law, establishing the fundamental principles, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions, as well as the fundamental rights, directive principles, and duties of citizens.

It serves as the foundational framework for the governance of India by:
* Defining the political code, organization, and powers of the state.
* Outlining limitations of government authority.
* Guaranteeing rights, justice, equality, liberty, and fraternity to all citizens.
* Acting as the legal basis from which all laws and practices must derive validity.

The Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950, marking the transformation of India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. It cannot be overridden by the Parliament and establishes a system of checks and balances through the separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Indian Constitution is also notable for being the world's longest written constitution, carefully detailing the rights of citizens and the structure of governance.

## 1.1. Meaning and Definition

A constitution is the fundamental and supreme law of a country that establishes the basic framework for governance and defines the relationship between the state and its citizens. It serves as the foundational document that outlines the structure, powers, and functions of government institutions while guaranteeing fundamental rights to the people.

The Constitution acts as the supreme law of the land, meaning all other laws must conform to its provisions and cannot contradict its principles. It establishes the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government to prevent the abuse of authority and ensure checks and balances. A constitution typically includes a Preamble that states the fundamental principles and aspirations of the nation, followed by provisions on government structure, citizens' rights, and amendment procedures.

Most constitutions are written documents that are deliberately drafted and adopted through a formal process, though some countries, like the United Kingdom, have unwritten constitutions based on traditions and conventions. The constitution provides legitimacy to the government by establishing clear rules about how political power is acquired, exercised, and transferred in society. It serves as a social contract between the rulers and the ruled, ensuring that government power is exercised for the public good rather than personal benefit.

Constitutional provisions are typically more difficult to amend than ordinary laws, requiring special procedures like supermajorities or referendums to maintain stability and protect core principles. In essence, a constitution creates the legal foundation for democracy, the rule of law, and constitutional governance that protects both individual freedoms and collective interests.

### 1.1.1. Definition of the Constitution

The Constitution of India is the fundamental and supreme legal document that establishes the framework for the governance of the Republic of India.

    * Aristotle defined a constitution as "the way by which all citizens or constituent parts of the state are organized in relation to each other."
    * Austin stated that a constitution "fixes the structure of supreme government."
* **Comprehensive Definition:** The Indian Constitution is a written document that lays down the framework demarcating the fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions, and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens.

# 3. CONSTITUTIONALISM

Besides the concept of the Constitution, there is also the all-important concept of ‘Constitutionalism’. Modern political thought draws a distinction between ‘Constitutionalism’ and ‘Constitution’. A country may have a ‘Constitution’ but not necessarily ‘Constitutionalism’. For example, a country with a dictatorship, where the dictator’s word is law, can be said to have a ‘Constitution’ but not ‘Constitutionalism’.

The underlying difference between the two concepts is that a Constitution ought not merely to confer powers on the various organs of the government, but also seek to restrain those powers. Constitutionalism recognizes the need for government but insists upon limitations being placed upon governmental powers. Constitutionalism envisages checks and balances and putting the powers of the legislature and the executive under some restraints and not making them uncontrolled and arbitrary. Unlimited powers jeopardize the freedom of the people. As has been well said: "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely." If the Constitution confers unrestrained power on either the legislature or the executive, it might lead to an authoritarian, oppressive government. Therefore, to preserve the basic freedoms of the individual, and to maintain his dignity and personality, the Constitution should be permeated with ‘Constitutionalism’; it should have some in-built restrictions on the powers conferred by it on governmental organs.

‘Constitutionalism’ connotes in essence limited government or a limitation on government. Constitutionalism is the antithesis of arbitrary powers. ‘Constitutionalism’ recognizes the need for government with powers, but at the same time insists that limitations be placed on those powers. The antithesis of Constitutionalism is despotism. Unlimited power may lead to an authoritarian, oppressive government which jeopardizes the freedoms of the people. Only when the Constitution of a country seeks to decentralize power instead of concentrating it at one point, and also imposes other restraints and limitations thereon, does a country have not only a ‘constitution’ but also ‘constitutionalism’.

‘Constitutions spring from a belief in limited government’. According to SCHWARTZ, in the U.S.A., the word Constitution means “a written organic instrument, under which governmental powers are both conferred and circumscribed.” He emphasizes that “this stress upon grant and limitation of authority is fundamental.”

A written Constitution, an independent judiciary with powers of judicial review, the doctrine of Rule of Law and separation of powers, free elections to the legislature, an accountable and transparent democratic government, Fundamental Rights of the people, federalism, and decentralization of power are some of the principles and norms which promote Constitutionalism in a country.

# 4. SALIENT FEATURES OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION

## 4.1. Written and Lengthy Constitution

# 5. THE PREAMBLE

The Preamble to the Constitution of India stands as the most significant introductory statement that encapsulates the philosophy, objectives, and fundamental values upon which the entire constitutional framework rests. Often described by eminent jurists as the "identity card" and "soul" of the Constitution, it provides both historical context and interpretative guidance for India's democratic governance.

## 5.1. Historical Background and Origin

The Preamble finds its roots in Jawaharlal Nehru's Objectives Resolution, presented to the Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946, and adopted on January 22, 1947. This resolution laid down the fundamental principles and aspirations that would guide the Constitution-making process. The Preamble was the first part to be introduced and the last to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly, demonstrating the careful deliberation that went into its formulation.

The Constituent Assembly engaged in extensive debates on October 17, 1949, discussing various aspects including the name of India and the inclusion of religious references. After thorough consideration, the Preamble was finally adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950 – Republic Day.

## 5.2. Text and Components of the Preamble

> "WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:
>

* **Words Added:**
    * "Socialist" – reflecting commitment to socio-economic equality.
    * "Secular" – emphasizing religious neutrality.
    * "Integrity" – changing "unity of the nation" to "unity and integrity of the nation."

This amendment, often called the "Mini-Constitution," was controversial due to its timing during the Emergency but has been constitutionally validated.

## 5.5. Legal Status and Judicial Interpretation

### Evolution of Judicial Understanding:

* **Berubari Union Case (1960):**
    * Initially held that the Preamble was *not* part of the Constitution.
    * Described it as "a key to open the mind of the makers" but not enforceable.
* **Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973):**
    * Landmark reversal – declared the Preamble as an **integral part** of the Constitution.
    * Established it as essential for constitutional interpretation under the **basic structure doctrine**.
    * Confirmed that while not a source of substantive powers, it guides interpretation.
* **Recent Judicial Affirmation (2024):**
    * In *Dr. Balram Singh vs. Union of India*, the Supreme Court dismissed challenges to the "socialist" and "secular" additions, reaffirming their constitutional validity.

## 5.6. Significance and Functions

1.  **Interpretative Guide:** Serves as the "guiding light" for interpreting constitutional provisions, resolving ambiguities in constitutional language, and providing context for fundamental rights and directive principles.
2.  **Constitutional Identity:** Defines the essential character and philosophy of the Indian state, reflecting the "political horoscope" of the nation (K.M. Munshi).
3.  **Basic Structure Protection:** Core elements of the Preamble are protected under the basic structure doctrine and cannot be amended in ways that destroy its fundamental character.
4.  **Moral and Philosophical Foundation:** Embodies the aspirations of the freedom struggle and provides a moral compass for governance and policy-making.
5.  **Unity in Diversity:** Promotes national integration across diverse communities and emphasizes common citizenship and shared values.

## 5.7. Amendability of the Preamble

The Supreme Court in *Kesavananda Bharati* established that:
1.  The Preamble can be amended under Article 368.
2.  Such amendments are subject to basic structure limitations.
3.  The amendment power extends to the Preamble but cannot destroy its essential features.

The 42nd Amendment serves as precedent that the Preamble is amendable, provided the basic structure remains intact.

## 5.8. Contemporary Relevance

The Preamble continues to serve as:
1.  A benchmark for constitutional interpretation in modern jurisprudence.
2.  A symbol of India's constitutional values in an evolving democracy.
3.  A framework for policy evaluation ensuring alignment with constitutional principles.
4.  A source of national identity that transcends political divisions.

## 5.9. Scope of the Preamble

1.  The Preamble of the Indian Constitution is the introductory statement that enunciates the source, nature, and objectives of the Constitution, reflecting the collective will of “We, the People of India.”
2.  In the *Berubari Union* case (1960), the Supreme Court held that the Preamble was not an enforceable part of the Constitution and could not confer powers or rights, but served as a “key to open the minds of the makers.”
3.  The landmark *Kesavananda Bharati* case (1973) overruled *Berubari*, declaring the Preamble to be an integral part of the Constitution and a component of its “basic structure,” thereby permitting its use in constitutional interpretation but precluding any amendment that would destroy its essential features.
4.  In *Union of India v. LIC* (1995), the Court reaffirmed *Kesavananda* by holding that the Preamble is part of the Constitution, emphasizing its role as the “heart and soul” that guides the understanding of all substantive provisions.
5.  The Preamble’s amendability was settled in *Kesavananda*: it can be amended under Article 368, but such amendments must respect the Constitution’s basic structure doctrine and cannot obliterate the Preamble’s core values.
6.  In *S.R. Bommai v. Union of India* (1994), the Supreme Court invoked the Preamble’s terms—especially secularism—to hold that secularism is part of the basic structure, thereby invalidating state actions that subverted religious neutrality.
7.  Functionally, the Preamble serves as an interpretative guide: when constitutional provisions are ambiguous, courts refer to the Preamble to ascertain the framers’ intent and the overarching constitutional philosophy.
8.  While not a source of substantive rights, the Preamble helps harmonize fundamental rights with Directive Principles by underscoring objectives such as justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.
9.  The Preamble also anchors the amendment process, as seen in the 42nd Amendment (1976), which inserted the words “Socialist,” “Secular,” and “Integrity,” thereby altering the Preamble’s textual statement of national ideals but within the permissible limits of the basic structure.
10. In sum, the scope of the Preamble in India encompasses its function as a declaratory preface, an interpretative tool, and a protected core of the Constitution that delineates its fundamental values and limits the legislature’s power to amend those values.

## 5.10. Importance of the Preamble

The Preamble to the Indian Constitution is far more than a mere introductory statement; it embodies the philosophical foundation, objectives, and basic values driving the constitutional framework. Its importance can be understood as follows:

1.  **Source of Sovereignty:** “We, the People of India” declares popular sovereignty, affirming that all authority flows from citizens rather than any monarch or legislature.
2.  **Expression of Constitutional Philosophy:** It succinctly states the nation’s core ideals—justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity—providing the moral compass for governance.
3.  **Declaratory Preface:** As a declaratory preface, the Preamble outlines the aims and objectives of the Constitution, guiding the interpretation of detailed provisions.
4.  **Interpretative Tool:** Courts use the Preamble as a “guiding light” when the constitutional text is ambiguous, ensuring that legislative and executive actions align with foundational goals.
5.  **Integral Part of the Constitution:** In *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973), the Supreme Court held that the Preamble is part of the Constitution’s basic structure, making it inviolable by amendment.
6.  **Limitation on Amendment Power:** While amendable under Article 368, any change must respect the Preamble’s essential features, safeguarding its core principles from legislative override.
7.  **Harmonizing Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles:** The Preamble balances justiciable rights with non-justiciable Directive Principles, guiding the state to promote welfare without undermining individual freedoms.
8.  **Judicial Recognition of Enforceability:** In *Union of India v. LIC* (1995), the Court reaffirmed the Preamble’s status as part of the Constitution, describing it as the “heart and soul” of the document.
9.  **Protection of Secularism:** Through cases like *S.R. Bommai v. Union of India* (1994), the Court invoked the Preamble’s secularism clause to invalidate state actions violating religious neutrality.
10. **Reflection of Historical Aspirations:** Originating from Nehru’s Objectives Resolution (1946), the Preamble captures the freedom struggle’s aspirations, linking modern governance to India’s path to independence.
11. **Definition of State Character:** Terms such as “Sovereign,” “Socialist,” “Secular,” “Democratic,” and “Republic” specify the nature of the Indian state and its governance model.
12. **Framework for National Unity:** By promising fraternity and integrity, it promotes national integration and counters divisive forces like regionalism and communalism.
13. **Guideline for Policy Formulation:** Legislatures and executives refer to the Preamble to ensure that laws and policies advance constitutional objectives, especially in welfare and social justice measures.
14. **Symbol of Constitutional Identity:** Often called the “Identity Card” or “Political Horoscope” of the Constitution, it uniquely identifies India’s constitutional ethos.
15. **Basis for Basic Structure Doctrine:** The Preamble underpins the Supreme Court’s basic structure doctrine, which limits constitutional amendments that alter foundational principles.
16. **Moral Force in Governance:** While not providing substantive rights, its aspirational language exerts moral pressure on state organs and society to uphold democratic values.
17. **Check on Majoritarianism:** By enshrining fundamental values above transient majorities, it serves as a constitutional check against populist or authoritarian measures.
18. **Educational Function:** As an accessible summary of constitutional goals, it educates citizens about their rights and duties, fostering civic awareness and participation.
19. **Historical Record of Constitutional Evolution:** The 42nd Amendment (1976)—which added “Socialist,” “Secular,” and “Integrity”—demonstrates the Preamble’s adaptability within the basic structure.
20. **Eternal Guiding Light:** In the words of the Supreme Court, the Preamble remains the “soul and key” of the Constitution, continuously guiding its interpretation and evolution in India’s democratic journey.

**Conclusion:** The Preamble’s importance lies in its dual role as both a declaratory preface and an interpretative guide that safeguards the Constitution’s core values. Recognized by landmark judgments as an integral part of the basic structure, it both empowers and constrains the state while offering a timeless vision of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for the Indian polity.

## 5.11. Objectives and Values Enshrined in the Preamble

The Preamble to the Constitution of India is the soul, guiding light, and philosophic cornerstone that proclaims the fundamental objectives and values of the Indian state. It lays down the ideals the nation strives to achieve and serves as an interpretative compass for courts, legislatures, and policymakers.

The Preamble reads:

> “We, the People of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:
>
> **JUSTICE**, social, economic and political;
>
> **LIBERTY** of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
>
> **EQUALITY** of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all
>
> **FRATERNITY** assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;”

### I. Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic

These descriptors define the character and nature of the Indian state:

1.  **Sovereign**
    * India’s complete independence and freedom from external control.
    * **Case Law:** Affirmed in *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973) as a basic feature that cannot be abrogated.
2.  **Socialist**
    * Added by the 42nd Amendment (1976) to emphasize socio-economic democracy and welfare state ideals.
    * **Case Law:** *Minerva Mills v. Union of India* (1980) struck down amendments undermining Directive Principles, reinforcing socialist goals as part of the basic structure.
3.  **Secular**
    * State neutrality in religious matters, equal respect for all faiths.
    * **Case Law:** *S.R. Bommai v. Union of India* (1994) held secularism as a basic feature, invalidating state proclamations favoring religion.
4.  **Democratic**
    * Power derives from the people through free and periodic elections.
    * **Case Law:** *Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain* (1975) protected free elections as part of the Constitution’s basic structure.
5.  **Republic**
    * The Head of State is elected, not hereditary.
    * **Case Law:** Implied in *Kesavananda Bharati* as part of the basic structure framework.

---

### II. Core Values and Objectives

#### 1. Justice (Social, Economic, Political)

**Objective:** To remove social and economic inequalities and ensure political fairness.

* **Social Justice:** Equality in social status, eradication of untouchability, and caste discrimination (Articles 15–17).
* **Economic Justice:** Fair distribution of wealth, right to work, education, and public assistance (Directive Principles, Article 39).
* **Political Justice:** Equal political rights, free and fair elections, and adult suffrage (Articles 325–326).

**Case Law:**

* *State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas* (1976): Held that the socialistic goal in the Preamble guides the interpretation of equality in the Directive Principles.
* *Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India* (2008): Upheld reservations for OBCs, stressing the Preamble’s social justice ethos.

#### 2. Liberty (Thought, Expression, Belief, Faith, Worship)

#### 3. Equality (of status and of opportunity)

**Objective:** To ensure that all citizens are equally protected by law, and that socio-economic status does not impede access to public life and opportunities.

#### 4. Fraternity (assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation)

**Objective:** To promote a sense of common brotherhood and national cohesion, upholding the dignity of every person while safeguarding the sovereignty and integrity of the nation.

# 6. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (PART III)

## 6.1. Right to Equality Under the Indian Constitution (Article 14)

Article 14: “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.”

### 6.1.1. Conceptual Foundations

1.  **Equality Before Law**
    * A negative concept imported from English common law.
    * Prohibits arbitrary privilege; ensures that no one is above the law.
2.  **Equal Protection of Laws**
    * An affirmative concept inspired by the U.S. Fourteenth Amendment.
    * Requires the State to treat similarly situated persons alike and differentiate only on reasonable grounds.

### 6.1.2. Scope of Article 14

1.  Applies to all State action—legislative, executive, and judicial.
2.  Governs both substantive legality (no arbitrary laws) and procedural fairness (equal process).
3.  Subject to the reasonable classification test:
    a) Intelligible differentia distinguishing persons or things;
    b) Rational nexus between the classification and the object of the legislation.

### 6.1.3. Landmark Case Law

1.  *State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar* (1952)
    * Struck down the West Bengal Special Courts Act as violating Article 14.
    * Held that classification based on individual cases without a rational basis is arbitrary.
    * Established that “like must be treated alike” and “unlike differently” only on reasonable grounds.
2.  *E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu* (1974)
    * Expanded Article 14 beyond rigid classification.
    * Held that Article 14 guarantees protection against arbitrariness—“equality is the antithesis of arbitrariness.”
3.  *State of Karnataka v. Manjunatha* (2005)
    * Reaffirmed that procedural fairness (audi alteram partem) is integral to Article 14.

### 6.1.4. Judicial Tests and Doctrines

1.  **Reasonable Classification Test** (*Anwar Ali Sarkar*): intelligible differentia + nexus.
2.  **Prohibition of Arbitrariness** (*Royappa*): no State action can be capricious, unfair, or disproportionate.

### 6.1.5. Contemporary Significance

1.  **Dynamic Evolution:** Courts have read Article 14 as a living guarantee against old and new forms of discrimination.
2.  **Intersection with Other Rights:** Used to reinforce rights under Articles 15 (non-discrimination), 19 (freedoms), and 21 (life and liberty).

Article 14 embodies both formal equality (uniform application of laws) and substantive equality (protection from arbitrary State action). Through seminal judgments—*Anwar Ali Sarkar*, *E.P. Royappa*, and recent rights-expanding cases—the Supreme Court has enforced Article 14 as a robust safeguard ensuring that India’s commitment to justice and non-discrimination remains both meaningful and adaptive.

#### Equality before the Law:

1.  This is a negative concept taken from the English Constitution.
2.  It implies:
    a) Absence of any special privileges in favour of any person.
    b) The subjection of all persons to the ordinary law of the land administered by ordinary law courts.
    c) No person is above the law.

### 6.1.6. Judicial Doctrines related to Article 13

Article 13(2) of the Constitution states: "The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void."

**A. Doctrine of Severability (Article 13(1) and 13(2))**

The Doctrine of Severability, or the Doctrine of Separability, states that when a part of a law violates the Constitution, and that part is separable from the rest of the law, then only that violating part will be declared void by the court, and the remainder of the law will remain operative. If the invalid part is integral to the entire Act, the whole Act will be held invalid.

**Case Law:**

* **A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (1950):**
    * In this case, Section 14 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, stated that a detainee may not disclose the grounds of his or her detention in a court of law. This particular statement was inconsistent with the fundamental rights as per Article 22 of the Indian Constitution.
    * Applying the doctrine of severability, the entire Act was not declared void; only Section 14 of the Act was declared void as it was inconsistent with the fundamental rights.
* **R.M.D.C. v. Union of India:**
    * The Supreme Court explained the doctrine as follows: “When a legislature whose authority is subject to limitations aforesaid enacts a law which is wholly in excess of its powers, it is entirely void and must be completely ignored. But when the legislation falls in part within the area allotted to it and in part outside it, it is undoubtedly void as to the latter; but does it on that become necessarily void in its entirety? The answer to this question must depend on whether what is valid could be separated from what is invalid, and that is a question which has to be decided by the Court.”

**B. Doctrine of Eclipse (Article 13(1))**

The Doctrine of Eclipse applies to laws enacted *before* the commencement of the Constitution (pre-constitutional laws). If a pre-constitutional law is inconsistent with a Fundamental Right (Article 13(1)), it is not rendered void *ab initio* (from the beginning) but is merely dormant or "eclipsed" by the Fundamental Right. Once the Fundamental Right that created the eclipse is itself amended or removed, the eclipsed law revives and becomes fully operational without the need for re-enactment.

**Case Law:**

* **Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of M.P. (1955):**
    * The C.P. and Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947 (a pre-constitutional law), was held to be eclipsed by Article 19(1)(g) which guaranteed the fundamental right to carry on any occupation.
    * Later, when Parliament passed the 1st Constitutional Amendment Act (1951), which restricted Article 19(1)(g), the eclipsed 1947 Act was revived and became operational again.

**C. Distinction: Pre- and Post-Constitutional Laws**

* **Deep Chand v. State of U.P. (1959):**
    * The Supreme Court held that the Doctrine of Eclipse applies only to pre-constitutional laws.
    * A law made *after* the Constitution's commencement that contravenes a Fundamental Right is void *ab initio* (void from the beginning) and therefore, a subsequent constitutional amendment cannot revive it.
* **State of Gujrat v. Ambika Mills (1974):**
    * Here, a certain labour welfare fund act was challenged, as certain sections in it were against the fundamental rights.
    * The question arose as fundamental rights are only granted to citizens, so what would happen in the case of non-citizens or a company (Ambika Mills)?
    * The Supreme Court held that since the fundamental rights are only granted to citizens but not to the company or any non-citizen, the labour welfare fund act is valid.
    * In this case, the Supreme Court modified its view as expressed in the *Deep Chand* case. In case the law contravenes a Fundamental Right limited to the citizens only, it will operate with respect to the non-citizens. Such a law will be regarded as ‘still-born’ vis-à-vis the citizens even though it may be operative *qua* the non-citizens, and so it will have to be revived.

**D. Is a Constitutional Amendment a 'Law'? (Article 13(2))**

The question whether the word “law” in clause (2) of Article 13 also includes a ‘Constitutional amendment’ was for the first time considered by the Supreme Court in:

* **Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India (1951):**
    * The Constitutional (1st Amendment) Act, 1951, which amended the fundamental rights guaranteed under the constitution, was challenged on the ground that since the amendment had the effect of abridging the fundamental rights it was not a valid law within the meaning of clause (2) of Article 13.
    * The contention was rejected by the apex court and it held that the word ‘law’ in clause (2) did not include a law made by the Parliament under Article 368 amending the constitution. It was said that the word ‘law’ means the “rules and regulations enacted by legislatures” and not the “constitutional amendments made in exercise of constituent powers.”
    * This judgment was followed by a majority of judgments, such as in *Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan*.
* **Golak Nath v. State of Punjab (1967):**
    * The apex court, by a 6:5 majority, held that the word “law” in Article 13(2) *does* include a law made under Article 368. This meant that the Parliament could not amend the Fundamental Rights.
* **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973):**
    * This judgment reversed *Golak Nath* and held that Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, under Article 368.
    * However, it introduced the **Basic Structure Doctrine**, stating that Parliament’s amending power is limited and cannot be used to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution.

The prescription of judicial review enables the judiciary to review pre-constitutional and existing laws. Although the intervention of the judiciary in constitutional matters is a debatable topic, the power of the judiciary is considered to be supreme and is summoned to guard and enforce the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Indian Constitution.

## 6.2. Right to Freedom (Article 19)

### 6.2.1. Freedom to Form Associations or Unions (Article 19(1)(c))

The right to form an association does not carry with it the right to recognition by the government. The right is not a Fundamental Right in itself unless the same is justified by Article 19(4).

* A co-operative society of canegrowers was formed to supply sugarcane to the sugar mills. The membership of the co-operative was voluntary. The canegrowers were free to join or not to join the society. The members were free to resign their membership except when indebted to the society. The Court held that the society did not fall foul of Article 19(1)(c).
* A High Court has held that the right to form an association necessarily implies that a person is free to refuse to be a member of an association if he so desires, and, therefore, a rule making it compulsory for every teacher to become a member of a government-sponsored association at the risk of suffering disciplinary action in case a teacher absents from two consecutive meetings infringes Article 19(1)(c).

### 6.2.2. Freedom of Movement and Residence: Arts. 19(1)(d), 19(1)(e) and 19(5)

**(Content Omitted in Original Upload)**

## 6.3. Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences (Article 20)

### 6.3.1. Article 20(1): Protection against Ex Post Facto Law

Article 20(1) says that "no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence." This provision protects an individual against retrospective (ex post facto) criminal legislation.

### 6.3.2. Article 20(2): Protection against Double Jeopardy

Article 20(2) states: “No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.” This protection is available only in proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal. It does not apply to departmental or administrative proceedings.

The concept of 'Issue Estoppel' precludes evidence being led to prove a fact in issue as regards which evidence has already been led and a specific finding recorded at an earlier criminal trial. Article 20(2) bars 'double punishment'; the rule of Issue Estoppel bars 'reception of evidence' on an issue on which the finding was in the favour of the accused at a previous trial. Article 20(2) has no direct bearing on the question at issue: it would be attracted only if the “offence” is the same in both the prosecutions.

### 6.3.3. Article 20(3): Protection against Self-Incrimination

Article 20(3) lays down that “no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.” In other words, the accused person is protected against incriminating himself under compulsion, e.g., 'making a statement which makes the case against the accused person at least probable considered by itself.'

* It can be claimed by natural persons as well as by corporations, etc.
* This clause is based on the maxim *nemo tenetur prodere accussare seipsum*, which means that 'no man is bound to accuse himself.'
* The accused is presumed to be innocent till his guilt is proved, and it is the duty of the prosecution to establish his guilt. Thus, the accused need not make any admission or statement against his free will.
* Clause (3) of Article 20 is an attempt to prevent the torture of the accused by investigating agencies for the purpose of extracting a confession from him.

**Person accused of an offence:** This immunity is available only to a person who is 'accused of an offence' (*M. R. Sharma v. Satish Chandra* AIR 1954 SC 3).

* Further, unlike the USA and England, the protection in India is confined to the 'accused' only and not to other witnesses.
* In *Nandini Sathpathy v. P.L. Dani* (AIR 1978 SC 1025), the Supreme Court held that the protection contained in Article 20(3) extends back to the stage of police investigation, not commencing in court only, since such inquiry was of an accusatory nature.
* Further, the ban on self-accusation and the 'right to silence' extends beyond that case and protects the accused in regard to other offences, pending or imminent, which might deter him or her from the voluntary disclosure of an incriminatory nature.

Article 20(3) provides that no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. The 'right to remain silent' is an extension of the rule of civil liberty enjoined by our Constitution.

## 6.4. Protection of Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21)

Article 21 states: "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law."

### 6.4.1. Scope of Right to Life and Personal Liberty

The word ‘personal liberty' in Article 21 is of the widest amplitude and it includes the “right to socialize'' with members of the family and friends, subject, of course, to any valid, reasonable prison regulations.

* The right of a detenu to consult a legal advisor of his choice for any purpose, including securing release from preventive detention, is included in the right to live with human dignity and is also part of personal liberty.
* The Right to 'live' is not merely confined to physical existence but it includes within its ambit the right to live with human dignity (*vide Maneka Gandhi case*), and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing, and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing, education and expressing ourselves in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings.

In *Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. UOI* (AIR 1984 SC 802), an organization dedicated to the cause of the release of bonded labourers informed the Supreme Court about a large number of labourers working in some stone-quarries under “inhuman and intolerable conditions.” The court observed that the right to live with human dignity derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy, and therefore, it must include protection of the health and strength of workers, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, and just and humane conditions of work.

### 6.4.2. Implied Fundamental Rights (Under Art. 21)

A new judicial trend has emerged from the cases of *Maneka Gandhi*, *Sunil Batra*, *Hoskot*, and *Hussainara Khatoon*, in which the Supreme Court has taken the view that the provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India should be given the widest possible interpretation. In *Maneka Gandhi’s* case, Justice Bhagwati said that the correct way of interpreting the provisions of Part III is that the court's attempt should be to expand the reach and ambit of the fundamental rights rather than to attenuate their meaning and content.

By an activist interpretation, most of the fundamental rights, especially the right to equality (Art. 14), freedom of speech and expression [Art. 19(1)(a)], and right to life and personal liberty (Art. 21) have been converted into a regime of positive human rights unknown in previous constitutional diction. By an affirmative action, the courts are trying to force the government to create favourable conditions for the effective realization of the new individual, collective, and diffuse rights.

The Supreme Court held that to be a fundamental right, it is not necessary that a right must be specifically mentioned in a particular Article. Even if it is not mentioned in any of the Articles specifically, it may be a fundamental right if it is an integral part of a named fundamental right or partakes of the same basic nature and character as that fundamental right. Every activity which facilitates the exercise of the Fundamental Right should be considered an integral part of it.

### 6.4.3. Right to Education (Implied)

The framers of the Constitution made it obligatory for the State to provide education for its citizens. The right to education is concomitant to the fundamental rights. Thus, the right to freedom of speech and expression cannot be fully enjoyed unless a citizen is educated and conscious of individualistic dignity. Without education, the dignity of the individual cannot be assured.

Article 21 includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it. The 'right to education' flows directly from the right to life because of its inherent fundamental importance in the life of an individual.

* The court further observed: The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide education at all levels and thus establish educational institutions at all levels (including professional education like medicine, engineering) for citizens (either State-owned or State-recognized).
* The ‘Capitation fee' (charging an amount beyond what is permitted by law, i.e., in excess of the prescribed fee) brings to the fore a clear class basis and makes the availability of education beyond the reach of the poor. Admission of non-meritorious students by charging a capitation fee strikes at the very root of the Constitutional scheme and our educational system. Education in India has never been a commodity for sale.

In *Unni Krishnan v. State of A.P.* (“Capitation Fee Case”) (AIR 1993 SC 2178), the five-judge bench, by a 3-2 majority, held that admission to all recognized private educational institutions, particularly medical and engineering, shall be based on merit, but 50% of seats in all professional colleges be filled by candidates prepared to pay a higher fee. The system devised by the court, the judgment stated, would mean correspondingly more financial burden on affluent students; whereas in the system prevalent in Andhra Pradesh, the financial burden is equally distributed among all the students, as a result of which a poor meritorious student is often unable to pay the enhanced fee prescribed by the government for such colleges. This is unjust and a violation of Article 14.

## 6.5. Protection Against Arrest and Detention (Article 22)

The Indian Constitution is wedded to Democracy and the Rule of Law. The concept of a free and fair trial is central to the administration of Criminal Law, which revolves around Natural Justice, wherein even the accused or guilty person is treated with human treatment. The law of the land requires the prosecution to stand on its own legs and to prove the guilt of the accused beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. The accused persons are also granted certain rights, the most basic of which are found in the Indian Constitution. An accused has certain rights during the course of any investigation, inquiry, or trial of the offence with which he is charged, and he should be protected against arbitrary or illegal arrest.

Our constitution is based on the fundamental principle that "Let Hundreds Go Unpunished, But Never Punish An Innocent Person." The right to get fair representation in a criminal procedure is a facet of the Right to Equality (Article 14).

### 6.5.1. Detention Under Article 22

Article 22 provides protection against arrest and detention in certain cases. It divides the protection into two parts:

1.  **Punitive Detention (Article 22(1) and 22(2)):** This is detention after a person is convicted of an offense. It provides the following safeguards:
    * The person arrested must be informed of the grounds of arrest as soon as possible.
    * The person must have the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his or her choice.
    * The person must be produced before the nearest Magistrate within 24 hours of arrest (excluding the time necessary for the journey).
    * The person cannot be detained beyond the said 24 hours without the authority of a Magistrate.

2.  **Preventive Detention (Article 22(3) to 22(7)):** This is detention without trial or inquiry. It is based on suspicion or apprehension that the person is likely to commit a crime. It is considered a necessary evil to ensure the safety and security of the nation. It provides the following safeguards:
    * The person can be detained for only three months in the first instance. If the period of detention is extended beyond three months, the case must be referred to an Advisory Board consisting of persons with qualifications for appointment as High Court judges. It is implicit that the period of detention may be extended beyond three months, only on approval by the Advisory Board.
    * The detainee is entitled to know the grounds of his detention. The state, however, may refuse to divulge the grounds of detention if it is in the public interest to do so. Needless to say, this power conferred on the state leaves scope for arbitrary action on the part of the authorities.
    * The detaining authorities must give the detainee the earliest opportunities for making a representation against the detention.

These safeguards are designed to minimize the misuse of preventive detention. It is because of these safeguards that preventive detention, basically a denial of liberty, finds a place in the chapter on Fundamental Rights. These safeguards are not available to enemy aliens.

### 6.5.2. Preventive Detention in India is a Constitutional Tyranny

India is one of the few countries in the world whose Constitution allows for preventive detention during peacetime without safeguards that elsewhere are understood to be basic requirements for protecting fundamental human rights.

* The constitutional scheme strips detainees of basic procedural rights provided by Articles 21, 22(1), and 22(2) of the Constitution.
* Article 22(1) of the Constitution, for example, guarantees the right to legal counsel, but Article 22(3)(b) strips this right from persons arrested or detained under preventive detention law.
* Relying on these provisions, the Supreme Court stated, in *A.K. Roy v. Union of India*, that detainees do not have the right to legal representation or cross-examination in Advisory Board hearings.
* Contrary to India's constitutional practice, the U.N. Human Rights Committee has stated that any persons arrested must have immediate access to counsel.
* Article 22(3)(b) of the Constitution—denying detainees virtually all procedural rights during Advisory Board hearings—must be repealed.
* Article 9(5) of the ICCPR provides the right to compensation for unlawful detention, except during public emergencies. A similar provision creating a right to compensation is included in section 38 of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill of 2000 (though the bill is otherwise effectively a reconstitution of the lapsed Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act).

## 6.6. Right to Constitutional Remedies – Analysis of Article 32

### 6.6.1. Right to Constitutional Remedies

Article 32 is known as the “spirit of the constitution and the exceptionally heart of it” by Dr. Ambedkar. The Supreme Court has included it in the fundamental structure regulation. Further, it is clarified that the privilege to move to the Supreme Court cannot be suspended except as otherwise provided by the Constitution. This suggests this privilege can be suspended during a national emergency under Article 359. Article 32 makes the Supreme Court the safeguard and guarantor of the fundamental rights. Further, the capacity to issue writs goes under the original jurisdiction of the Apex Court. This implies an individual may approach the Supreme Court directly for a remedy rather than by appeal. Article 32 can be used only to get a remedy for fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 12-35. It is not available for any other legal right for which diverse laws are available.

### 6.6.2. What is a WRIT?

A writ is a precept in writing, couched in the form of a letter, running in the name of the king, president, or state, issuing from a court of justice, and sealed with its seal. It is addressed to a sheriff or other officer of the law, or directly to the person whose action the court desires to command, either as the commencement of a suit or other proceeding or as incidental to its progress, and requiring the performance of a specified act, or giving authority and commission to have it done.

* In old English law, "writ" was used as equivalent to “action;” hence writs are sometimes divided into real, personal, and mixed.
* In Scotish law, "writ" means writing; an instrument in writing, as a deed, bond, contract, etc.

### 6.6.3. Constitutional Philosophy of Writ Jurisdiction

An individual whose privilege (Fundamental Right) is encroached by an arbitrary administrative action may approach the Court for a suitable remedy.

Article 32(2) of the Constitution of India provides: “The Supreme Court will have the capacity to issue bearings or requests or writs, incorporating writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari, whichever might be appropriate, for the requirement of any of rights given by this Part.”

Article 32 is a Basic Right directly under Part III of the Constitution. Under this Article, the Supreme Court is enabled to loosen up the customary rule of *Locus Standi* and allow the public to file a case in the name of Public Interest Litigation (PIL).

### 6.6.4. Comparative Analysis of Article 32 and 226

Article 32 is not to be invoked for the encroachment of an individual right of agreement (contract), nor is it to be invoked for unsettling disputes which are fit for transfer under other laws.

Article 226(1) of the Constitution of India, on the other hand, says, “Notwithstanding anything in Article 32, every High Court shall have powers, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any Government, within those territories directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibitions, quo warranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose.”

As is obvious from the naked dialect, this Article ensures a person to move the High Court for the implementation of the fundamental rights and also for the implementation of some other lawful right. Article 226 gives wide powers to the High Courts. It serves as a major repository of legal capacity to control administration. Its capacity under Article 226 cannot be diminished by enactment. Thus, the powers of High Courts provided under Article 226 are broader when compared to powers conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.

### 6.6.5. Types of WRITS

**Habeas Corpus:**

Meaning: This writ is in the nature of an order calling upon the person who has detained another to produce the latter before the Court, in order to let the Court know on what ground he is detained.

**(The remaining descriptions of writs are omitted in the original upload.)**

# 7. RIGHT TO PROPERTY (ARTICLE 300A)

Article 300A: “No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.”

The following points were established regarding the Right to Property (before and after it ceased to be a Fundamental Right):
1.  The right to acquire, hold, and dispose of property guaranteed by Article 19(1)(f) is not a basic feature of the Constitution.
2.  The word ‘compensation’ in Article 31(2) does not mean the market value of the property and its adequacy is not justiciable.
3.  Deprivation of the right to acquire, hold, and dispose of property in certain circumstances may amount to deprivation of the said right.
4.  Whether a restriction imposed by law on a fundamental right is reasonable and in the public interest or not, is a justiciable issue.
5.  The state can by law, deprive a person of his property if the said law of deprivation amounts to reasonable restriction in the public interest within the meaning of Article 19(5).
6.  The state can acquire or requisition the property of a person for a public purpose after paying compensation.
7.  The adequacy of the compensation is not justiciable.
8.  If the compensation fixed by law is illusory or is contrary to the principles relevant to the fixation of compensation, it would be a fraud on power and therefore the validity of such a law becomes justiciable.
9.  Laws of agrarian reform depriving or restricting the rights in an ‘estate’—the said expression has been defined to include practically every agricultural land in a village—cannot be questioned on the ground that they have infringed fundamental rights.

## 7.1. Amending Power of the Parliament

Another path-breaking development, which is till today being considered as the most trivial phase faced by the judiciary and legislature in the entire Constitutional history of our nation was triggered off by the *Kesavananda Bharati* case.

The only relevant point is the fact that under the Constitution no person can be deprived of their property without the authority of law. The two relevant concepts that now require to be examined are 'property' and 'Authority by law'.

### 7.1.1. 'Property' as understood in Article 300A

The obvious first question is as to whether or not 'intellectual property' such as 'clinical trial data' would fall within the definition of 'property' as understood in Article 300A. There seems to be enough authority to support the proposition that 'property' as understood in Article 300A is wider than just 'immovable property'. One such authority in the context of 'intellectual property rights' is the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of *Entertainment Network India Ltd.*

# 8. FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES (PART IVA)

## 8.1. List of Fundamental Duties (Article 51A)

Fundamental Duties were incorporated into the Constitution by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976.

The fundamental duties are:
1.  To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag, and the National Anthem.
2.  To cherish and follow the noble ideas that inspired our national struggle for freedom.
3.  To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.
4.  To defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so.
5.  To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic, and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women.
6.  To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.
7.  To protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures.
8.  To develop the scientific temper, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry and reform.
9.  To safeguard public property and to abjure violence.
10. To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavor and achievement.
11. To provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between the age of six and fourteen years (added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002).

## 8.2. Significance of Fundamental Duties

1.  **Promote Discipline:** They promote a sense of discipline and commitment toward the nation.
2.  **Act as a Warning:** They act as a warning to anti-national and anti-social elements.
3.  **Source of Inspiration:** They serve as a source of inspiration for the citizens and promote a sense of discipline and commitment among them.
4.  **Aid to Interpretation:** They help the Court in examining the constitutional validity of a law.
5.  **Constitutional Balance:** They enable citizens to realize their duties toward the country and society.
6.  **Democratic Behaviour:** They remind citizens that while enjoying their rights, they must also be conscious of their duties.

## 8.3. Comparison with Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)

| Feature | Fundamental Duties | Directive Principles of State Policy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Part** | Part IVA | Part IV |
| **Applicability** | Apply to citizens only | Apply to the State/Government |
| **Nature** | Non-justiciable, moral obligations | Non-justiciable, socio-economic goals |
| **Relationship** | Guides citizens in their conduct | Guides the State in governance |

## 8.4. Duty to Vote

The right to vote in an election is an integral part of the Constitution in which the Indian Constitution does not provide still today. The "right to work" should, therefore, be guaranteed to every citizen who is expected to do certain things for the nation.

## 8.5. Enforcement of Duties

The fundamental duties are statutory duties and shall be enforceable by law. Parliament, by law, will provide penalties to be imposed for failure to fulfil those duties and obligations. The success of this provision would, however, depend much upon the manner in which and the person against whom these duties would be enforced, and for its proper enforcement, it is necessary that it should be known to all.

* In *AIIMS Students Union v. AIIMS* AIR (1983) 1 SCC 471, it has been held that Fundamental Duties, though not enforceable by a writ of the court, yet provide a valuable guide and aid to the interpretation of constitutional and legal issues.

## 8.6. Criticism

1.  **Vagueness:** Some of the duties are vague and the terms used therein are complex, which even a highly educated man would find difficult to grasp, like the difficulty in identifying the noble ideas that inspired our national struggle for freedom.
2.  **Conflict with Religion:** Some of the duties clash with the religious principles of some religious sects in the country. In one Judgment, the Supreme Court held that no person can be forced to join the singing of the National Anthem if he has genuine religious obligations which place religious belief above patriotism.
3.  **Lack of Sanction:** There is no specific provision nor any sanction as to the implementation and enforcement of Fundamental Duties.
