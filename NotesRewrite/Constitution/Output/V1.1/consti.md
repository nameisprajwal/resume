## **Introduction to Constitution**

A constitution is the fundamental and supreme law of a country that establishes the basic framework for governance and defines the relationship between the state and its citizens. It serves as the foundational document that outlines the structure, powers, and functions of government institutions while guaranteeing fundamental rights to the people. The constitution acts as the supreme law of the land, meaning all other laws must conform to its provisions and cannot contradict its principles. It establishes the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government to prevent abuse of authority and ensure checks and balances.

A constitution typically includes a preamble that states the fundamental principles and aspirations of the nation, followed by provisions on government structure, citizens' rights, and amendment procedures. Most constitutions are written documents that are deliberately drafted and adopted through a formal process, though some countries like the United Kingdom have unwritten constitutions based on traditions and conventions. The constitution provides legitimacy to the government by establishing clear rules about how political power is acquired, exercised, and transferred in society. It serves as a social contract between the rulers and the ruled, ensuring that government power is exercised for the public good rather than personal benefit.

Constitutional provisions are typically more difficult to amend than ordinary laws, requiring special procedures like supermajorities or referendums to maintain stability and protect core principles. In essence, a constitution creates the legal foundation for democracy, the rule of law, and constitutional governance that protects both individual freedoms and collective interests.

The Constitution of India is the country's supreme law, establishing the fundamental principles, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions, as well as the fundamental rights, directive principles, and duties of citizens.

It serves as the foundational framework for the governance of India by:

* Defining the political code, organization, and powers of the state
* Outlining limitations of government authority
* Guaranteeing rights, justice, equality, liberty, and fraternity to all citizens
* Acting as the legal basis from which all laws and practices must derive validity

The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950, marking the transformation of India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. It cannot be overridden by the Parliament and establishes a system of checks and balances through separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Indian Constitution is also notable for being the world's longest written constitution, carefully detailing the rights of citizens and the structure of governance.

## **Definition of Constitution**

# **CONSTITUTIONALISM**

Besides the concept of the Constitution, there is also the all-important concept of "Constitutionalism". Modern political thought draws a distinction between "Constitutionalism" and "Constitution". A country may have a "Constitution" but not necessarily "Constitutionalism". For example, a country with a dictatorship, where the dictator's word is law, can be said to have a "Constitution" but not "Constitutionalism".

The underlying difference between the two concepts is that a Constitution ought not merely to confer powers on the various organs of the government, but also seek to restrain those powers. Constitutionalism recognizes the need for government but insists upon limitations being placed upon governmental powers. Constitutionalism envisages checks and balances and putting the powers of the legislature and the executive under some restraints and not making them uncontrolled and arbitrary. Unlimited powers jeopardize freedom of the people. As has been well said: "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."

If the Constitution confers unrestrained power on either the legislature or the executive, it might lead to an authoritarian, oppressive government. Therefore, to preserve the basic freedoms of the individual, and to maintain his dignity and personality, the Constitution should be permeated with "Constitutionalism"; it should have some in-built restrictions on the powers conferred by it on governmental organs.

"Constitutionalism" connotes in essence limited government or a limitation on government. Constitutionalism is the antithesis of arbitrary powers. "Constitutionalism" recognizes the need for government with powers but at the same time insists that limitations be placed on those powers. The antithesis of Constitutionalism is despotism. Unlimited power may lead to an authoritarian, oppressive government which jeopardizes the freedoms of the people.

Only when the Constitution of a country seeks to decentralize power instead of concentrating it at one point, and also imposes other restraints and limitations thereon, does a country have not only "constitution" but also "constitutionalism". "Constitutions spring from a belief in limited government". According to Schwartz, in the U.S.A., the word Constitution means "a written organic instrument, under which governmental powers are both conferred and circumscribed". He emphasizes that "this stress upon grant and limitation of authority is fundamental".

A written Constitution, independent judiciary with powers of judicial review, the doctrine of rule of law and separation of powers, free elections to legislature, accountable and transparent democratic government, Fundamental Rights of the people, federalism, and decentralization of power are some of the principles and norms which promote Constitutionalism in a country.

## **Salient Features of the Indian Constitution**

### 1. Written and Lengthy Constitution

* The Indian Constitution is the longest written constitution in the world.
* It originally had 395 Articles and 8 Schedules; now it contains over 450 Articles and 12 Schedules, covering all aspects of governance in exhaustive detail.

### 2. Drawn from Multiple Sources

The Constitution incorporates features from various countries such as:

* Parliamentary System (UK)
* Fundamental Rights, Judicial Review (USA)
* Directive Principles (Ireland)
* Federal structure (Canada)

This comparative approach ensures best practices and adaptability.

### 3. Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility

* Some provisions (like federal structure) require a special amendment process, making them rigid.
* Others can be changed by simple majority, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

### 4. Federal System with Unitary Bias

* Division of powers between the Union and States (Three lists: Union, State, Concurrent).
* However, in times of emergency or under certain conditions, the Centre can assert more powers (unitary features).

### 5. Parliamentary Form of Government

* The President is the nominal executive; the real power rests with the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.
* The executive is responsible to the legislature—embodying the core tenet of the parliamentary system.

* Establishes India as the largest democratic country in the world.

### 8. Single Citizenship

* Unlike some federal countries (such as the USA), India provides for single citizenship for all, fostering unity.

### 9. Fundamental Rights and Duties

### 10. Directive Principles of State Policy

* Inspired by the Irish Constitution, these are guidelines to establish a welfare state (Part IV).
* Although non-justiciable, they direct government policy towards social and economic democracy.

### 11. Independent Judiciary

### 15. Amendment Procedure

* Part XX (Article 368) provides a process that is neither too rigid nor too flexible, allowing for necessary changes while ensuring core principles are protected.

### 16. Bicameral Legislature

* At the Union level (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), some states also have two houses, ensuring broader representation.

### 17. Special Status to Some States

* Article 370 (now abrogated for J&K) and other provisions (371-A to 371-J) grant special provisions to certain states, recognizing India's diversity.

## **Conclusion**

The Indian Constitution stands out due to its comprehensiveness, adaptability, and blend of diverse features catering to the country's unique needs. It is a living document that evolves with changing times while safeguarding the values of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.

# **PREAMBLE**

The Preamble to the Constitution of India stands as the most significant introductory statement that encapsulates the philosophy, objectives, and fundamental values upon which the entire constitutional framework rests. Often described by eminent jurists as the "identity card" and "soul" of the Constitution, it provides both historical context and interpretative guidance for India's democratic governance.

## **Historical Background and Origin**

The Preamble finds its roots in Jawaharlal Nehru's Objectives Resolution, presented to the Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946, and adopted on January 22, 1947. This resolution laid down the fundamental principles and aspirations that would guide the Constitution-making process. The Preamble was the first part to be introduced and the last to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly, demonstrating the careful deliberation that went into its formulation.

The Constituent Assembly engaged in extensive debates on October 17, 1949, discussing various aspects including the name of India and the inclusion of religious references. After thorough consideration, the Preamble was finally adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950—Republic Day.

## **Text and Components of the Preamble**

"WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:

JUSTICE, social, economic and political;

LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;

EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all

FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;

IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION."

## **Analysis of Key Components**

### 1. Source of Authority: "We, the People of India"

* Establishes popular sovereignty—the ultimate authority derives from the people
* Reflects the democratic foundation where the Constitution is "a power of attorney given by the people, not a charter given by power"
* Emphasizes unity in diversity by referring to all Indians collectively despite their varied backgrounds

### 2. Nature of the Indian State

* **Sovereign:** India possesses complete independence and authority, free from external control
* **Socialist:** Added by the 42nd Amendment (1976), it signifies the state's commitment to economic and social democracy, mixed economy, and welfare state principles
* **Secular:** Also added by the 42nd Amendment, it ensures equal respect and protection for all religions, with the state maintaining neutrality in religious matters
* **Democratic:** Establishes a system where authority flows from the people through elected representatives
* **Republic:** Ensures that the head of state (President) is elected, not hereditary

### 3. Fundamental Objectives

**Justice (Social, Economic, and Political):**

* Social Justice: Equal treatment and opportunities regardless of background
* Economic Justice: Fair distribution of resources and equal pay for equal work
* Political Justice: Equal political rights and participation in governance

**Liberty (of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship):**

* Guarantees fundamental freedoms while ensuring they don't infringe on others' rights
* Not absolute liberty but qualified liberty within constitutional limitations

**Equality (of status and opportunity):**

* Civic Equality: Through fundamental rights (Articles 14-18)
* Political Equality: Through universal adult franchise (Articles 325-326)
* Economic Equality: Through directive principles promoting equal opportunities

**Fraternity (ensuring dignity of individual and unity and integrity of the nation):**

* Promotes brotherhood and national integration
* Addresses challenges like communalism, regionalism, and linguism
* Originally stated "unity of the nation," changed to "unity and integrity of the nation" by the 42nd Amendment

## **The 42nd Amendment and Its Impact**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976, enacted during the Emergency period, made significant changes to the Preamble:

**Words Added:**

* "Socialist"—reflecting commitment to socio-economic equality
* "Secular"—emphasizing religious neutrality
* "Integrity"—changing "unity of the nation" to "unity and integrity of the nation"

This amendment, often called the "Mini-Constitution," was controversial due to its timing during Emergency but has been constitutionally validated.

## **Legal Status and Judicial Interpretation**

### Evolution of Judicial Understanding

**Berubari Union Case (1960):**

* Initially held that the Preamble was not part of the Constitution
* Described it as "a key to open the mind of the makers" but not enforceable

**Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973):**

* Landmark reversal—declared Preamble as integral part of the Constitution
* Established it as essential for constitutional interpretation under the basic structure doctrine
* Confirmed that while not a source of substantive powers, it guides interpretation

**Recent Judicial Affirmation (2024):**

* In Dr. Balram Singh vs Union of India, the Supreme Court dismissed challenges to "socialist" and "secular" additions, reaffirming their constitutional validity

## **Significance and Functions**

### 1. Interpretative Guide

* Serves as the "guiding light" for interpreting constitutional provisions
* Resolves ambiguities in constitutional language
* Provides context for fundamental rights and directive principles

### 2. Constitutional Identity

* Defines the essential character and philosophy of the Indian state
* Reflects the "political horoscope" of the nation (K. M. Munshi)

### 3. Basic Structure Protection

* Core elements of the Preamble are protected under the basic structure doctrine
* Cannot be amended in ways that destroy its fundamental character

### 4. Moral and Philosophical Foundation

* Embodies the aspirations of the freedom struggle
* Provides moral compass for governance and policy-making

### 5. Unity in Diversity

* Promotes national integration across diverse communities
* Emphasizes common citizenship and shared values

## **Amendability of the Preamble**

The Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati established that:

* The Preamble can be amended under Article 368
* Such amendments are subject to basic structure limitations
* The amendment power extends to the Preamble but cannot destroy its essential features

The 42nd Amendment serves as precedent that the Preamble is amendable, provided the basic structure remains intact.

## **Contemporary Relevance**

The Preamble continues to serve as:

* A benchmark for constitutional interpretation in modern jurisprudence
* A symbol of India's constitutional values in an evolving democracy
* A framework for policy evaluation ensuring alignment with constitutional principles
* A source of national identity that transcends political divisions

## **Conclusion**

The Preamble to the Indian Constitution represents far more than a mere introduction—it is the philosophical foundation upon which Indian democracy stands. As the "soul and key to the Constitution", it embodies the collective aspirations of the Indian people for justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. Its evolution through the 42nd Amendment and continued judicial protection under the basic structure doctrine demonstrates its dynamic yet enduring character.

The Preamble's significance lies not just in its historical importance but in its continuing role as the moral compass that guides India's constitutional journey. It remains a testament to the vision of the Constitution-makers and serves as an eternal reminder of the ideals that the Indian nation strives to achieve. In the words of Nehru, it represents "a firm resolution and a solid promise"—a commitment that continues to shape India's democratic destiny.

## **Scope of Preamble**

1. The Preamble of the Indian Constitution is the introductory statement that enunciates the source, nature, and objectives of the Constitution, reflecting the collective will of "We, the People of India".

2. In the Berubari Union case (1960), the Supreme Court held that the Preamble was not an enforceable part of the Constitution and could not confer powers or rights, but served as a "key to open the minds of the makers."

3. The landmark Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) overruled Berubari, declaring the Preamble to be an integral part of the Constitution and a component of its "basic structure," thereby permitting its use in constitutional interpretation but precluding any amendment that would destroy its essential features.

4. In Union of India v. LIC (1995), the Court reaffirmed Kesavananda by holding that the Preamble is part of the Constitution, emphasizing its role as the "heart and soul" that guides the understanding of all substantive provisions.

5. The Preamble's amendability was settled in Kesavananda: it can be amended under Article 368, but such amendments must respect the Constitution's basic structure doctrine and cannot obliterate the Preamble's core values.

6. In S. R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994), the Supreme Court invoked the Preamble's terms—especially secularism—to hold that secularism is part of the basic structure, thereby invalidating state actions that subverted religious neutrality.

7. Functionally, the Preamble serves as an interpretative guide: when constitutional provisions are ambiguous, courts refer to the Preamble to ascertain the framers' intent and the overarching constitutional philosophy.

8. While not a source of substantive rights, the Preamble helps harmonize fundamental rights with Directive Principles by underscoring objectives such as justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.

9. The Preamble also anchors the amendment process, as seen in the 42nd Amendment (1976), which inserted the words "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity," thereby altering the Preamble's textual statement of national ideals but within the permissible limits of basic structure.

10. In sum, the scope of the Preamble in India encompasses its function as a declaratory preface, an interpretative tool, and a protected core of the Constitution that delineates its fundamental values and limits the legislature's power to amend those values.

## **Importance of the Preamble**

The Preamble to the Indian Constitution is far more than a mere introductory statement; it embodies the philosophical foundation, objectives, and basic values driving the constitutional framework. Its importance can be understood under the following headings:

1. **Source of Sovereignty:** "We, the People of India" declares popular sovereignty, affirming that all authority flows from citizens rather than any monarch or legislature.

2. **Expression of Constitutional Philosophy:** It succinctly states the nation's core ideals—justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity—providing the moral compass for governance.

3. **Declaratory Preface:** As a declaratory preface, the Preamble outlines the aims and objectives of the Constitution, guiding the interpretation of detailed provisions.

4. **Interpretative Tool:** Courts use the Preamble as a "guiding light" when constitutional text is ambiguous, ensuring that legislative and executive actions align with foundational goals.

5. **Integral Part of the Constitution:** In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Supreme Court held that the Preamble is part of the Constitution's basic structure, making it inviolable by amendment.

6. **Limitation on Amendment Power:** While amendable under Article 368, any change must respect the Preamble's essential features, safeguarding its core principles from legislative override.

7. **Harmonizing Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles:** The Preamble balances justiciable rights with non-justiciable Directive Principles, guiding the state to promote welfare without undermining individual freedoms.

8. **Judicial Recognition of Enforceability:** In Union of India v. LIC (1995), the Court reaffirmed the Preamble's status as part of the Constitution, describing it as the "heart and soul" of the document.

9. **Protection of Secularism:** Through cases like S. R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994), the Court invoked the Preamble's secularism clause to invalidate state actions violating religious neutrality.

10. **Reflection of Historical Aspirations:** Originating from Nehru's Objectives Resolution (1946), the Preamble captures the freedom struggle's aspirations, linking modern governance to India's path to independence.

11. **Definition of State Character:** Terms such as "Sovereign," "Socialist," "Secular," "Democratic," and "Republic" specify the nature of the Indian state and its governance model.

12. **Framework for National Unity:** By promising fraternity and integrity, it promotes national integration and counters divisive forces like regionalism and communalism.

13. **Guideline for Policy Formulation:** Legislatures and executives refer to the Preamble to ensure that laws and policies advance constitutional objectives, especially in welfare and social justice measures.

14. **Symbol of Constitutional Identity:** Often called the "Identity Card" or "Political Horoscope" of the Constitution, it uniquely identifies India's constitutional ethos.

15. **Basis for Basic Structure Doctrine:** The Preamble underpins the Supreme Court's basic structure doctrine, which limits constitutional amendments that alter foundational principles.

16. **Moral Force in Governance:** While not providing substantive rights, its aspirational language exerts moral pressure on state organs and society to uphold democratic values.

17. **Check on Majoritarianism:** By enshrining fundamental values above transient majorities, it serves as a constitutional check against populist or authoritarian measures.

18. **Educational Function:** As an accessible summary of constitutional goals, it educates citizens about their rights and duties, fostering civic awareness and participation.

19. **Historical Record of Constitutional Evolution:** The 42nd Amendment (1976)—which added "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity"—demonstrates the Preamble's adaptability within the basic structure.

20. **Eternal Guiding Light:** In the words of the Supreme Court, the Preamble remains the "soul and key" of the Constitution, continuously guiding its interpretation and evolution in India's democratic journey.

## **Conclusion**

The Preamble's importance lies in its dual role as both a declaratory preface and an interpretative guide that safeguards the Constitution's core values. Recognized by landmark judgments as an integral part of the basic structure, it both empowers and constrains the state while offering a timeless vision of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for the Indian polity.

## **Objectives and Values Enshrined in the Preamble**

The Preamble to the Constitution of India is the soul, guiding light, and philosophic cornerstone that proclaims the fundamental objectives and values of the Indian state. It lays down the ideals the nation strives to achieve and serves as an interpretative compass for courts, legislatures, and policymakers. The Preamble reads:

"We, the People of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:

JUSTICE, social, economic and political;

LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;

EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all

FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;"

This answer discusses each objective and value, supported by pertinent case law and brief explanations.

## **I. Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic**

These descriptors define the character and nature of the Indian state:

1. **Sovereign:** India's complete independence and freedom from external control. Case Law: None directly, but affirmed in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) as a basic feature that cannot be abrogated.

2. **Socialist:** Added by the 42nd Amendment (1976) to emphasize socio-economic democracy and welfare state ideals. Case Law: Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980) struck down amendments undermining Directive Principles, reinforcing socialist goals as part of the basic structure.

3. **Secular:** State neutrality in religious matters, equal respect for all faiths. Case Law: S. R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994) held secularism as a basic feature, invalidating state proclamations favoring religion.

4. **Democratic:** Power derives from the people through free and periodic elections. Case Law: Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975) court protected free elections as part of the Constitution's basic structure.

5. **Republic:** Head of state is elected, not hereditary. Case Law: Implied in Kesavananda Bharati as part of the basic structure framework.

## **II. Core Values and Objectives**

### 1. Justice (Social, Economic, Political)

**Objective:** To remove social and economic inequalities and ensure political fairness.

* Social Justice: Equality in social status, eradication of untouchability, caste discrimination (Art. 15–17).
* Economic Justice: Fair distribution of wealth, right to work, education, public assistance (Dir. Princ. Art. 39).
* Political Justice: Equal political rights, free and fair elections, adult suffrage (Art. 325–326).

**Case Law:**

* State of Kerala v. N. M. Thomas (1976): Held that socialistic goal in Preamble guides Directive Principles to interpret equality.
* Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India (2008): Upheld reservations for OBCs, stressing Preamble's social justice ethos.

### 2. Liberty (Thought, Expression, Belief, Faith, Worship)

**Objective:** Guarantee fundamental freedoms within constitutional limits (Art. 19–22).

**Case Law:**

* Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978): Expanded "personal liberty" (Art. 21) to include wide-ranging freedoms, aligning with Preamble's liberty value.
* Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras (1950): Struck down press restrictions, affirming freedom of expression.

### 3. Equality (Status, Opportunity)

**Objective:** Ensure equal treatment before law and equal access to opportunities (Art. 14–18).

**Case Law:**

* E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu (1974): Reimagined equality as a dynamic concept—"equality is a continuum" under Art. 14.
* Subhash Sharma v. Union of India (2009): Affirmed gender equality in government appointments.

### 4. Fraternity (Dignity, Unity, Integrity)

**Objective:** Foster brotherhood, respect for human dignity, and national integration.

**Case Law:**

* Keshavananda Bharati: Recognized fraternity as inherent to the Constitution's basic structure.
* Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980): Prohibition of inhuman punishment reflects human dignity value.

## **III. Functional Significance**

1. **Interpretative Aid:** Kesavananda Bharati (1973): Preamble guides Court's understanding of constitutional provisions. R. Bommai (1994): Used it to interpret secularism.

2. **Limitation on Amendment:** Basic Structure Doctrine: Core Preamble values (sovereignty, secularism, democracy, justice) cannot be abrogated.

3. **Harmonizing Rights and Principles:** Guides reconciliation of justiciable rights (Part III) with Directive Principles (Part IV).

4. **Moral and Philosophical Anchor:** Provides ethical grounding for legislation and judicial decisions.

5. **Symbolic Function:** Serves as India's constitutional identity—"soul and key" to the document.

## **Conclusion**

The Preamble's objectives and values—sovereignty, socialism, secularism, democracy, republic, justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity—constitute the bedrock of the Indian Constitution. Cemented by landmark cases like Kesavananda Bharati, S. R. Bommai, and Maneka Gandhi, these principles form the basic structure that guides interpretation, limits amendment, and shapes the trajectory of India's democratic evolution. For a comprehensive exposition, a thorough treatment would analyze each value, link it to constitutional provisions, discuss relevant case law, and explain how the Preamble underpins India's constitutional ethos and judicial safeguards.

## **CITIZENSHIP**

A citizen enjoys fundamental rights including the right to work, right to vote, right to return, etc. in his or her country. At the same time, the citizen is also bound to observe duties of citizenship. It reflects that the right to citizenship is not an absolute one, and the legislature may impose reasonable restrictions on the enjoyment of one's citizenship.

Every country has its own immigration laws which regulate the entry and stay of immigrants. The right to participate in the government is also being regulated by the immigration laws. For this, the countries differentiate between "nationality" and "citizenship". However, it has also been seen that countries sometimes make strict immigration laws and exclude foreigners on a discriminatory basis. That is why the International Conventions and other instruments have a check on such immigration laws.

There are many ways of acquiring citizenship of a country. Citizenship can be acquired by birth, marriage, honorary basis, etc. Some modes of acquisition are automatic. However, immigration laws nowadays are strict to regulate false marriages, where people marry each other for money or other benefits. States also grant honorary citizenship.

Citizens are full members of the state. These citizens enjoy full civil and political rights. Aliens are not entitled to all constitutional and other rights because they are not citizens. For example, in India, aliens have the right to life and personal liberty but not the freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. Furthermore, enemy aliens suffer many more difficulties. In India, enemy aliens cannot enforce Article 22 of the Constitution which protects the rights of accused persons detained under preventive detention laws.

"Stateless Persons" are persons who are not citizens of any country. Their status is similar to aliens.

### **What is Citizenship?**

The population of a state is divided into two categories: citizens and non-citizens. A citizen of a state enjoys all civil and political rights. A non-citizen, on the other hand, does not enjoy these rights.

Under the Indian Constitution, certain fundamental rights are available only to the citizens, namely:

* Right against discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth (Article 15)
* Right to equality of opportunity in matter of public employment (Article 16)
* Freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association, movement, residence and profession (Article 19)
* Cultural and educational rights (Article 29 and 30)
* Right to vote and become members of the union and state legislatures

Several offices can also be occupied exclusively by citizens:

* President (Article 58(1)(a))
* Vice-President (Article 66(2))
* Judges of the Supreme Court (Article 124(3)) and High Court (Article 217(2))
* Governor of a state (Article 157)
* Attorney General (Article 76(1)) and Advocate General (Article 165)

Equality before the law or equal protection of the laws within the territory of India (Article 14) and protection of life or personal liberty (Article 21) are applicable to non-citizens as well.

### **What Are the Constitutional Provisions Relating to Citizenship in India?**

The Indian Constitution does not prescribe a permanent provision relating to citizenship in India. It simply describes categories of persons who are deemed to be citizens of India on the day the Indian Constitution was promulgated on January 26, 1950, and leaves citizenship to be regulated by law made by the Parliament.

Article 11 of the Constitution confers power on the Parliament to make laws regarding citizenship. The Indian Citizenship Act, 1955 was enacted in exercise of this provision.

### **Who Were the Persons Deemed to Be Citizens of India When the Constitution Was Promulgated?**

1. **Citizenship by Domicile (Article 5):** A person who was born in India or either of the person's parents was born in India or the person must have been ordinarily resident in the territory of India for not less than five years immediately before the commencement of the Constitution.

Domicile of a person is in that country in which the person either has or is deemed by law to have his/her permanent house.

The term "domicile" has not been defined in the Indian Constitution. "Domicile" means the place where a person's habitation is fixed without any present intention of moving therefrom. Every person has a domicile at birth called the domicile of origin. The domicile of origin remains unchanged until the person acquires a new domicile, that is, by actually settling in another country with the intention of permanently residing there. Till then the domicile of origin continues even if he has left the country with an intention of never returning again.

The onus to prove that a person has changed his domicile of origin lies upon him. It has been held by the Supreme Court that there must be factum and animus to constitute the existence of domicile in India. Similarly, the Supreme Court said in Louis De Raedt v Union of India, that the person should show his appropriate state of mind required for acquisition of domicile by choice. In Pradeep Jain v Union of India, the Supreme Court held that there is only one domicile in India. The court said that the domicile does not change with the change of residence within India. A minor or married person does not have the legal capacity to make a change of domicile. Therefore, a minor carries the domicile of his father and a married woman gets the domicile of her husband.

2. **Citizenship of Migrants to India from Pakistan (Article 6):** Persons who have migrated from Pakistan to India have been classified into two categories:

* Those who came to India before July 19, 1948
* Those who came on or after July 19, 1948

In the case of persons migrating before July 19, 1948, if the person has been ordinarily residing in India since the date of her migration, and in case of a person migrating on or after July 19, 1948, if he/she has been registered as a citizen of India, after residing for at least six months immediately before the date of applying for registration, by an officer appointed by the Government of India, shall be deemed to be a citizen of India.

3. **Citizenship of Migrants from Pakistan (Article 7):** If a citizen of India has migrated to Pakistan after March 1, 1947, but returned to India on the basis of permit for resettlement in India, the person is entitled to become a citizen of India if he/she registers herself as a citizen of India, after residing for at least six months immediately before the date of applying for registration, by an officer appointed by the Government of India.

Both Articles 6 and 7 use the term "migrated". The meaning of the term "migrated" came into consideration of Supreme Court in Kulathi v State of Kerala. The majority held that the word "migrate" was used in a wider sense of moving from one country to another with the qualification that such movement was not for a short visit or for a special purpose.

### **State of Bihar v. Kumar Amar Singh**

Kumar Rani went to Karachi in July 1948 leaving her husband in India. She returned to India in December 1948 after obtaining a temporary permit, stating in her application for the said permit that she was domiciled in Pakistan and she was a Pakistani national. On expiry of the permit she went back to Pakistan in April 1949. On May 14, 1953 she came back to India under permanent permit obtained from High Commissioner for India in Pakistan, which was cancelled on July 12, 1950, because it was wrongly issued without the concurrence of the Government as required by the rules made under the Influx from Pakistan (Control) Act, 1949.

She contended, alternatively, that the proviso to Article 7 applied to her since she had returned to India on a permanent permit and the subsequent cancellation of the permit was illegal and irrelevant. She made an application for permanent settlement in India through having citizenship under Article 5. The Supreme Court observed: "Article 7 clearly overrides Article 5. It is pre-emptory in its scope and makes no exception for such a case, i.e., of the wife migrating to Pakistan leaving her husband in India."

4. **Citizenship of Persons of Indian Origin Residing Outside India (Article 8):** Indian nationals (whose parents or any grandparents were born in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935) residing abroad shall be conferred Indian citizenship, as if they have been registered by the diplomatic or consular representatives of India in the country where they are residing.

Article 8 provides for the rights of citizenship of certain persons of Indian origin residing outside India. Article 9 provides that no person shall be a citizen of India by virtue of Article 5, or be deemed to be a citizen of India by virtue of Article 6 or Article 8, if he has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign State. It deals only with voluntary acquisition of citizenship of a foreign state before the Constitution came into force.

Under Article 10, Parliament may take away the right of citizenship of any person.

Article 11 gives a proper way to the Parliament for making any law relating to Citizenship. While exercising the authority, the Parliament enacted the Citizenship Act, 1955 for the acquisition and termination of citizenship in India.

## **Citizenship Under the Citizenship Act, 1955**

Parliament has enacted the Citizenship Act, 1955, to provide for the acquisition and determination of Indian Citizenship. The Act provides for acquisition of Indian citizenship after the commencement of the Constitution in five ways: birth, descent, registration, naturalization and incorporation of territory.

### **Citizenship by Birth**

A person acquires citizenship by birth if he is born on or after 26th January 1950 but before 1st July, 1987. In this case, there is no need to determine the nationality of his parents.

But in case where he is born on or after 1st July, 1987 but before 3rd December, 2004, it is necessary that either of his parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth.

After 3rd December, 2004, he acquires citizenship by birth if both the parents are citizens of India or one of the parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth. An "illegal migrant" means a foreigner who entered India without a valid passport or documents or remains in India beyond the permitted period of time.

### **Citizenship by Descent**

Section 4 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 provides that a person born outside India on or after 26th January 1950 but before 10th December 1992 is a citizen of India by descent, if his father was a citizen of India by birth at the time of his birth.

A person born outside India on or after 10th December 1992 but before 3rd December, 2004, is considered to be a citizen of India if either of his parents was a citizen of India by birth at the time of his birth.

A person born outside India on or after 3rd December, 2004 shall not be a citizen of India, unless the parents declare that the minor does not hold passport of another country and his birth is registered at an Indian consulate within one year of the date of birth or with the permission of the Central Government, after the expiry of the said period.

### **Citizenship by Registration**

Under Section 5 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, a person who has been ordinarily residing in India for seven years before making the application or who has been ordinarily residing in any other country outside undivided India, would acquire Indian citizenship by registration.

A person can also register himself or herself as Indian citizen if he or she gets married to an Indian citizen who has been ordinarily residing in India for seven years before making application. Both minor and major children of Indian citizens could also acquire citizenship by registration.

A registered overseas citizen of India (OCI) for five years and who has been residing in India for one year before making application, would also get citizenship by registration.

### **Citizenship by Naturalization**

A person is granted a certificate of naturalization if the person is not an illegal migrant and has resided in India for 12 months before making an application to seek the certificate. Of the 14 years preceding this 12-months duration, the person must have stayed in India for 11 years.

### **Citizenship by Incorporation of Territory**

If any new territory becomes a part of India, the Government of India shall specify the persons of the territory to be citizens of India. If the central Government is of the opinion that an applicant is a person who has rendered distinguished service to the cause of science, philosophy, art, literature, world peace or human progress generally, it may waive all or any conditions specified to attain Indian citizenship.

## **Overseas Citizenship**

The Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003 provided for acquisition of overseas citizenship of India by persons of Indian origin of 16 specified countries other than Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 2005, the Act was further amended in order to grant more overseas citizenship of India to persons of Indian origin of all countries except Pakistan and Bangladesh.

By this amendment, the earlier requirement of period of residence in India was also reduced from two years to one year for persons registered as overseas citizens of India to acquire Indian citizenship.

The Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) Scheme was introduced by amending the Citizenship Act, 1955 in August 2005. The Scheme was launched in 2006. The Scheme provides for registration as Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) of all Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) who were citizens of India on 26th January, 1950 or thereafter or were eligible to become citizens of India on 26th January, 1950. However, the scheme excludes citizens of Pakistan and Bangladesh.

**Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) does not mean "dual citizenship".**

Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) does not confer any political right on the concerned persons. The registered Overseas Citizens of India cannot enjoy the same status as that of Indian citizens in case of equal opportunities in public employment. It means Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cannot enforce Article 16 of the Indian Constitution.

Furthermore, Overseas citizens of India cannot enjoy voting rights. Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cannot enjoy the right to hold offices like President, Vice-President, Judge of Supreme Court and High Court, Member of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, Legislative Assembly or Council. Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cannot be appointed to the Public Services.

However, Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) enjoys some other rights. A registered Overseas Citizen of India gets Indian visa for his whole life. He or she enjoys the same status as that of Non-Resident Indians in matters of inter-country adoption, tariffs in domestic air fares, entry fee for visiting national parks, national monuments, museums, etc. in India.

Overseas citizen is eligible to practice professions of doctors, dentists, nurses and pharmacists, Advocates, Architects, Chartered Accountants in India. However, Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) does not enjoy the same parity with Non-Resident Indians in matters of agricultural properties.

## **Renunciation, Termination and Deprivation of Citizenship**

Section 8 of the Citizenship Act 1955 provides that a major and capable person can renounce his or her Indian citizenship. On renunciation, his minor child also loses citizenship. However, the minor child can resume the Indian citizenship after attaining the age of majority.

Section 9(1) of the Citizenship Act 1955 provides that an Indian citizen loses his Indian citizenship if he or she acquires the citizenship of another country. It has also been held by the Honourable Supreme Court that section 9 is a complete code regarding the termination of Indian Citizenship on the acquisition of the citizenship of a foreign country.

On renunciation or termination, the concerned person has to surrender his or her Indian passport to the authorities under the Passport Act. If he or she fails to do so, he or she is liable to receive prescribed punishment.

**Deprivation of citizenship** means compulsory termination of citizenship in India. Section 10 provides that the Central Government may terminate a person's citizenship on certain grounds like the person commits fraud in registration, the person is not loyal towards the Constitution of India, the person is trading or communicating with enemy when India is at war, the person's citizenship is not in favour of public good, etc.

Increasingly, in the case of Hari Shankar Jain v Sonia Gandhi, the Supreme Court opined that a petition to challenge one's citizenship can be filed before the High Court or election judge.

### **Is Corporation a Citizen?**

The Supreme Court in State Trading Corporation v Commercial Tax Officer held that company or corporation is not a citizen of India and cannot claim fundamental rights. The court said that citizenship is concerned with natural persons only. The court said that citizenship cannot be conferred upon the juristic persons.

However, the Supreme Court in Cooper v Union of India, also known as Bank Nationalization case, held that a shareholder of a company should be considered as an Indian citizen and is entitled to the protection given under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. The Fundamental rights of the shareholders as citizens should not be violated by any state action.

In Bennett Coleman Case, the Supreme Court again said that the State action not only affects the right of newspapers companies but also of the editors, readers and shareholders. These individuals do have freedom of speech and expression which should be protected against any unreasonable State action.

In Godhra Electric Co. Ltd v State of Gujarat the court held that a managing director of a company had right to carry on business through agency of company. The court said that he had right to challenge the constitutional validity of the concerned enactment.

Following Bank Nationalization and Bennett Coleman cases, the Supreme Court in D. C. & G. M. v Union of India, has held that writ petition filed by a company complaining denial of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 is maintainable.

The Constitution of India provides for a single citizenship for the entire country. The provisions relating to citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution are contained in Articles 5 to 11 in Part II of the Constitution of India. The Citizenship Act enacted by the Parliament in 1955 provides for acquisition and determination of citizenship.

## **Termination of Citizenship**

Section 9 of the Citizenship Act 1955 provides that an Indian citizen loses his Indian citizenship automatically if he or she acquires the citizenship of another country voluntarily.

Section 10 of the Citizenship Act 1955 provides that the Central Government may deprive a person of his or her Indian citizenship on certain grounds:

* The person obtained citizenship by fraud or concealment of any material fact in the application.
* The person has shown disaffection or disloyalty towards the Constitution of India.
* The person has unlawfully traded or communicated with an enemy state during wartime.
* The person has been engaged in commercial activity or practices.
* It is not in the best interest of the public good to retain the citizenship.

When the Central Government issues a notice for deprivation, the concerned person gets a reasonable opportunity to present his case before the deprivation takes effect. The person has the right to approach the High Court to challenge the decision.

## **Stateless Persons**

Stateless persons are individuals who are not considered nationals by any country under the operation of its law. They have no citizenship of any country and thus enjoy very limited rights. In India, stateless persons are treated similarly to aliens and do not enjoy the same fundamental rights as Indian citizens. However, they enjoy certain limited protections under the Indian Constitution.

## **International Status of Citizenship**

Various International Conventions and Protocols deal with citizenship and migration rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) recognizes the right to a nationality in Article 15. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) also provides for protection of citizens' rights regardless of their immigration status in certain cases.

## **Conclusion**

Citizenship is a fundamental legal and political status that determines the relationship between an individual and the state. The Indian Constitution and the Citizenship Act, 1955 provide comprehensive provisions for acquisition, determination, renunciation, and deprivation of citizenship. The provisions ensure that India maintains a single citizenship system while also recognizing the rights of non-citizens and persons of Indian origin living abroad through the Overseas Citizenship of India scheme. Through these provisions, India balances the need for territorial integrity and national security with humanitarian concerns and the protection of individual rights.

# **PART II—CONTINUED: CITIZENSHIP (ADVANCED TOPICS)**

## **Case Law on Citizenship**

The Indian Supreme Court has been instrumental in clarifying and interpreting citizenship provisions. Several landmark cases have shaped the understanding of citizenship in India:

### **Kulathi v. State of Kerala**

The Supreme Court examined the meaning of "migration" under Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution. The court held that migration means moving from one country to another with the intention of permanent or semi-permanent settlement, not mere temporary travel or visits.

### **State of Bihar v. Kumar Amar Singh**

This case dealt with the retrograde application of citizenship provisions. The court held that Article 7 clearly overrides Article 5 and is pre-emptory in its scope, making no exceptions for cases involving married women who migrated to Pakistan leaving their husbands in India.

### **Dr. Ambedkar's Vision on Citizenship**

Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, in his role as Chairman of the Drafting Committee, emphasized that citizenship should be uniform throughout India. This principle of single citizenship was intended to foster national unity and integration despite India's federal structure.

## **Practical Aspects of Citizenship**

### **Passport and Travel Documents**

Indian citizens are entitled to obtain Indian passports as travel documents. The passport serves as proof of Indian citizenship and is regulated by the Passport Act, 1967. Loss of citizenship means loss of the right to hold an Indian passport.

### **Dual Citizenship and Its Impossibility in India**

India does not permit dual citizenship. A person cannot simultaneously hold Indian citizenship and the citizenship of another country. The Citizenship Act, 1955 explicitly provides that acquisition of foreign citizenship results in automatic loss of Indian citizenship.

### **Non-Resident Indians (NRIs)**

Non-Resident Indians are Indian citizens residing abroad. They retain their Indian citizenship and enjoy all associated rights, including the right to return to India and seek re-employment. They may also acquire Overseas Citizenship status if eligible.

### **Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs)**

Persons of Indian Origin are individuals whose parents or grandparents were born in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935. They may acquire Overseas Citizenship status if they meet the eligibility criteria.

## **Recent Amendments and Developments**

### **Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019**

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 to provide a faster process for citizenship acquisition for persecuted minorities (Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain, and Parsi) from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh who entered India before December 31, 2014.

### **Passport Act Amendments**

Various amendments to the Passport Act have streamlined the process of passport issuance and revocation, making it more efficient while maintaining security protocols.

## **Statelessness Prevention**

India has taken measures to prevent statelessness through:

* Liberal provisions for citizenship by descent for children born to Indian parents abroad.
* Liberal provisions for citizenship by registration for Persons of Indian Origin.
* Protective measures to ensure that renunciation of citizenship is not arbitrarily permitted.

## **Constitutional Rights Specific to Citizens**

The following rights and offices are restricted to Indian citizens:

1. **Fundamental Rights:**
   * Freedom of speech and expression (Article 19(1)(a))
   * Freedom to assemble peaceably (Article 19(1)(b))
   * Freedom of association (Article 19(1)(c))
   * Right to equality of opportunity in public employment (Article 16)
   * Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29-30)

2. **Political Rights:**
   * Right to vote in elections
   * Right to contest elections to Parliament and State Legislatures
   * Right to hold public offices

3. **Constitutional Offices Reserved for Citizens:**
   * President
   * Vice-President
   * Prime Minister
   * Governor
   * Supreme Court and High Court Judges
   * Attorney General and Advocate Generals

## **Rights of Non-Citizens in India**

Although non-citizens do not enjoy the same rights as citizens, they are entitled to certain protections:

* Right to equality before the law (Article 14)
* Right to life and personal liberty (Article 21)
* Protection against exploitation (Article 23-24)
* Protection against arrest and detention (limited, under Article 22)

## **Comparison of Citizenship Status**

| Status | Rights | Political Participation | Duration | Special Benefits |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Indian Citizen** | All Fundamental and Political Rights | Full | Lifelong (unless renounced/deprived) | Right to hold all offices |
| **OCI** | Limited (no political rights) | None (cannot vote) | Indefinite | Lifetime visa, same fees as NRI |
| **NRI** | All rights of citizens | Full | Lifelong | Special economic privileges |
| **Alien/Foreigner** | Limited (Art. 14, 21) | None | Duration of visa/permit | Regulated by immigration laws |

## **Conclusion on Citizenship**

Citizenship remains a cornerstone of the Indian constitutional framework. The provisions for acquisition, termination, and rights attached to citizenship reflect the Constitution-makers' vision of a unified, democratic, and inclusive nation. The Citizenship Act, 1955, as amended multiple times, continues to adapt to contemporary needs while maintaining the foundational principle of single citizenship for India. Through judicial interpretation and legislative amendments, India has developed a comprehensive citizenship regime that balances national security, human rights, and humanitarian concerns.

# **UNIT II—FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS**

## **Introduction to Fundamental Rights**

Fundamental Rights are the basic rights guaranteed to all citizens of India by the Constitution. These rights are called "fundamental" because they are essential for the development of the human personality and for leading a dignified life. Unlike other rights that may be created and taken away by laws, Fundamental Rights are protected directly by the Constitution.

The Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Indian Constitution (Articles 12-35). They apply to Indian citizens, though in some cases they extend to all persons, including non-citizens. These rights cannot be taken away by ordinary laws; only a constitutional amendment can modify or restrict these rights.

## **Historical Background**

The concept of Fundamental Rights was borrowed from the United States Constitution, where they are called the "Bill of Rights". However, the Indian Constitution provides a more comprehensive list of Fundamental Rights adapted to the Indian context.

Dr. B. R. Ambedkar emphasized during the Constituent Assembly debates that Fundamental Rights were meant to create an egalitarian society where every individual, regardless of their social or economic status, could develop their potential.

## **Characteristics of Fundamental Rights**

1. **Constitutional Status:** These rights are guaranteed by the Constitution itself, making them supreme over all other laws.

2. **Inalienable:** These rights cannot be taken away or suspended except in the manner specified by the Constitution (e.g., during emergencies).

3. **Enforceable by Courts:** These rights can be enforced through writ petitions to the courts, particularly the Supreme Court and High Courts.

4. **Primarily for Citizens:** Most Fundamental Rights apply only to citizens of India, though some (like Article 14 and 21) apply to all persons, including non-citizens.

5. **Capable of Reasonable Restrictions:** While absolute protection is provided, the State may impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of these rights for the public good.

## **Classification of Fundamental Rights**

The Fundamental Rights under the Indian Constitution are divided into six categories:

### **1. Right to Equality (Articles 14-18)**

This includes:

* **Equality before law (Article 14):** No person shall be denied equality before the law or equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.
* **Prohibition of discrimination (Article 15):** The State shall not discriminate on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
* **Equality of opportunity (Article 16):** There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.
* **Abolition of untouchability (Article 17):** Untouchability is abolished, and its practice in any form is forbidden.
* **Abolition of titles (Article 18):** The State shall not confer titles (except military and academic honors) on any person.

### **2. Right to Freedom (Articles 19-22)**

This category includes several freedoms:

* **Freedom of speech and expression (Article 19(1)(a)):** All citizens have the right to freedom of speech and expression.
* **Freedom to assemble peaceably (Article 19(1)(b)):** Citizens have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms.
* **Freedom of association (Article 19(1)(c)):** Citizens have the right to form associations or unions.
* **Freedom of movement (Article 19(1)(d)):** Citizens have the right to move freely throughout the territory of India.
* **Freedom to reside and settle (Article 19(1)(e)):** Citizens have the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India.
* **Freedom to practice any profession (Article 19(1)(f)):** Citizens have the right to practice any profession, occupation or trade.

However, these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the State as specified in Article 19(2)-(6).

* **Protection against arrest and detention (Articles 20-22):** These provide protections to persons accused of crimes, including protection against ex post facto laws, double jeopardy, and self-incrimination.

### **3. Right against Exploitation (Articles 23-24)**

* **Prohibition of traffic in human beings (Article 23):** No person shall be subjected to or forced into traffic or other forms of forced labor.
* **Prohibition of employment of children (Article 24):** Children shall not be employed in factories, mines, or other hazardous occupations.

### **4. Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25-28)**

* **Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion (Article 25):** All persons have the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality, and health.
* **Right to manage religious affairs (Article 26):** Religious denominations shall have the right to manage their own affairs in matters of religion.
* **Freedom as to payment of taxes for religious purposes (Article 27):** No person shall be compelled to pay any tax for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion.
* **Freedom as to religious education (Article 28):** No religious instruction shall be imparted in educational institutions wholly maintained by the State.

### **5. Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29-30)**

* **Protection of interests of minorities (Article 29):** Any section of the citizens residing in India shall have the right to conserve their culture, language, and script.
* **Right of minorities to establish educational institutions (Article 30):** All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

### **6. Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)**

* This article gives citizens the right to move the Supreme Court by writ petitions (habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari) to enforce Fundamental Rights.
* Article 226 gives High Courts similar powers.

## **Application and Scope**

### **Who Can Exercise Fundamental Rights?**

Most Fundamental Rights apply only to "citizens" of India. However, some rights apply to "persons," which includes both citizens and non-citizens:

* **Article 14:** Applies to all persons
* **Article 15:** Applies to citizens
* **Article 16:** Applies to citizens
* **Article 20:** Applies to all persons
* **Article 21:** Applies to all persons

### **Restrictions on Fundamental Rights**

Fundamental Rights are not absolute. The Constitution permits reasonable restrictions on these rights:

* **Article 19(2)-(6):** Specify restrictions on freedoms under Article 19.
* **Article 25:** Specifies that freedom of religion is subject to public order, morality, and health.
* **Article 26(b):** Allows regulation of religious practices that are against public order.

## **Conclusion on Fundamental Rights**

Fundamental Rights form the backbone of Indian democracy, ensuring that every individual is treated with dignity and respect. They protect citizens against state oppression and ensure that citizens can develop their personalities to the fullest extent. Over the years, courts have expanded the interpretation of these rights to meet contemporary challenges and evolving social standards.

# **ARTICLE 14: EQUALITY BEFORE LAW**

## **Introduction and Text**

Article 14 of the Indian Constitution states: "The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India."

This is one of the most important and widely litigated articles of the Constitution. It applies to all persons, not just citizens, and is the foundation upon which the entire edifice of constitutional rights rests.

## **Meaning of "Equality Before the Law"**

"Equality before the law" means that:

1. **No person is above the law:** Every person, regardless of social status, position, or wealth, is subject to the same laws and legal procedures as any other person.

2. **Equal application of laws:** Laws must be applied equally to all persons in similar circumstances.

3. **No arbitrary action:** The State cannot take any action that is arbitrary, unreasonable, or based on personal whim.

4. **Rule of Law:** All persons are subject to the rule of law, and no person can exercise authority except in accordance with law.

## **Meaning of "Equal Protection of the Laws"**

"Equal protection of the laws" means that:

1. **Protection of rights:** All persons are entitled to the equal protection of the laws within Indian territory.

2. **Non-discrimination:** Laws shall not discriminate between persons on the basis of irrelevant considerations.

3. **Reasonable classification permitted:** While the State cannot discriminate arbitrarily, it can make reasonable classifications for legitimate purposes.

4. **Substantive equality:** Beyond formal equality, it includes equality in the substantive enjoyment of rights.

## **Doctrine of Reasonable Classification**

The courts have evolved the doctrine of reasonable classification to balance the absolute prohibition on discrimination with the practical need for the State to classify persons and enact differential laws.

### **Tests for Reasonable Classification**

For a classification to be reasonable, it must satisfy the following tests:

1. **Classification must be based on an intelligible differentia:** The classification must be based on a clear, distinct, and visible characteristic that distinguishes one group from another.

2. **The differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved:** There must be a rational connection between the classified groups and the purpose of the law.

3. **The differentia must not be arbitrary or based on mere whim:** The classification must serve a legitimate governmental objective.

4. **The object of the statute must be legitimate:** The law must aim at achieving a legitimate public purpose.

### **Classic Formula (State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar)**

The Supreme Court in State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar established the classic test:

* The classification must be based on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things grouped together from others left out of the group.
* The differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute.

## **Landmark Cases on Article 14**

### **Airlift Kapur v. Union of India**

The Supreme Court struck down a provision that gave differential pension rights to officers of different cadres, holding that the distinction was not based on any intelligible differentia.

### **Champakam Dorairajan v. State of Madras**

The court held that a law providing for reservation of seats in educational institutions on a communal basis violated Article 14. However, the court upheld the right to provide reservations based on other criteria like backward castes.

### **Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras**

While primarily a case on freedom of expression, this case also upheld Article 14 by striking down press licensing restrictions as arbitrary and not reasonably related to any legitimate governmental objective.

### **Ishwar Chandra Sharma v. State**

The court held that a law that seeks to improve the conditions of a particular class of people by granting them special privileges does not violate Article 14 if such classification is reasonable and rational.

## **Modern Interpretation: Substantive Equality**

### **E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu (1974)**

Justice H. R. Khanna observed: "Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within the strait jacket of a dictionary meaning. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetical to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a Republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch."

This judgment expanded the concept of equality beyond formal equality to include substantive equality.

### **Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980)**

The court held that equality is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be amended in a manner that destroys it.

## **Scope and Applicability**

### **Who Can Invoke Article 14?**

Article 14 applies to "any person," meaning it applies to both citizens and non-citizens. Even foreign nationals and corporations can invoke Article 14 to challenge arbitrary State action.

### **Against Whom Does Article 14 Apply?**

Article 14 applies against "the State." The term "State" is defined in Article 12 to include:

* The Government and Parliament of India
* The Government and Legislature of each State
* All local authorities
* Other authorities under the control of the Government

### **State Action Doctrine**

Article 14 primarily applies against State action. Private parties are not directly bound by Article 14. However, courts have held that the State cannot indirectly violate Article 14 by delegating its functions to private parties.

## **Permissible Classification Under Article 14**

The following classifications have been held to be reasonable and permissible:

1. **Classification based on need:** Classification of persons on the basis of their economic or social need for welfare measures.

2. **Classification based on occupation:** Different regulations for different professions or occupations.

3. **Classification based on purpose:** Different rules for achieving different objectives.

4. **Classification based on geography:** Different rules for different regions, subject to rational basis.

5. **Classification based on age:** Differential treatment based on age for purposes like education, employment, etc.

6. **Classification based on gender:** When based on objective differences, like special protections for pregnant women.

7. **Classification for backward classes:** Special provisions for economically backward or socially disadvantaged classes.

## **Impermissible Classification Under Article 14**

The following classifications have been held to be arbitrary and violative of Article 14:

1. **Based on caste:** Classification based solely on caste has been held to be arbitrary.

2. **Based on religion:** Classification based on religious affiliation is arbitrary (except when religion is essential to a job or position).

3. **Based on gender:** Blanket classification based on gender without rational basis is impermissible.

4. **Purely arbitrary classification:** Classification with no rational basis or intelligible differentia.

5. **Retrograde classification:** Classification that goes against established principles of equality.

## **Conclusion on Article 14**

Article 14 stands as the sentinel of constitutional justice, ensuring that all persons are treated with equal respect and dignity before the law. While permitting reasonable classifications, it prevents arbitrary and discriminatory State action. Through judicial interpretation, Article 14 has evolved from a mere formal guarantee of equality to a dynamic principle ensuring substantive equality and dignity.

# **ARTICLE 15: PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION**

## **Introduction and Text**

Article 15 of the Indian Constitution states: "The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth."

Article 15 further provides (in clause 4 and 4A, added by amendments) that the State may make special provisions for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

## **Meaning and Scope**

### **Direct Discrimination (Article 15(1))**

Clause (1) provides an absolute prohibition against discrimination on the specified grounds. It is a complete ban on discrimination based on:

* Religion
* Race
* Caste
* Sex
* Place of Birth

This provision ensures that no person is discriminated against in the enjoyment of rights and privileges merely on these grounds.

### **Discrimination in Public Employment (Article 15(2))**

Clause (2) states: "No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in relation to, any employment or office under the State."

This clause specifically addresses discrimination in public employment, ensuring that merit—not these protected characteristics—determines employment decisions.

### **Discrimination in Educational Institutions (Article 15(5))**

Clause (5) states: "Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the State from providing for the reservation of appointments or posts in the services under the State in favor of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State."

This clause permits positive discrimination through reservations for backward classes in educational institutions and employment.

## **Distinction Between Article 14 and Article 15**

| Aspect | Article 14 | Article 15 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Applicability** | All persons (citizens and non-citizens) | Only citizens |
| **Scope** | General prohibition of arbitrary discrimination | Specific prohibition on grounds listed |
| **Nature** | Negative—forbids arbitrary classification | Negative—forbids discrimination on listed grounds |
| **Basis of prohibition** | Arbitrariness | Specified grounds |
| **Exception** | Reasonable classification permitted | Special provisions for backward classes |

## **Grounds of Prohibited Discrimination**

### **1. Religion**

The State cannot discriminate on the basis of a citizen's religious beliefs or practices. This includes:

* Not providing equal services or benefits to followers of different religions
* Not denying rights because of religious affiliation
* Not requiring citizens to follow or renounce any religion

**Exception:** The State may regulate religious practices that are contrary to public order or morality.

### **2. Race**

Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin is prohibited. In the Indian context, this is rarely the subject of litigation but remains a constitutional protection.

### **3. Caste**

This is perhaps the most significant ground in the Indian context. The Constitution explicitly abolishes untouchability and all discrimination based on caste. The Supreme Court has held that any law or practice that discriminates on the basis of caste is violative of Articles 15 and 17.

### **4. Sex**

Discrimination based on sex or gender is prohibited. However, the courts have recognized that certain protective measures for women (like separate accommodation in trains or prisons) do not violate Article 15 because they are based on objective differences.

### **5. Place of Birth**

The State cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of the place where they were born. This ensures national integration and prevents regional discrimination.

## **Positive Discrimination and Reservations**

### **Article 15(4): Special Provisions for Backward Classes**

Article 15(4) permits the State to make special provisions for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of admission to educational institutions (including private institutions receiving aid from the State).

This clause represents an exception to the prohibition on discrimination and permits "positive discrimination" or "reverse discrimination" for the advancement of backward classes.

### **Article 15(4A): Reservations for EWS**

Added by the 103rd Amendment Act, 2019, this clause permits the State to make special provisions (including reservations) for the advancement of economically weaker sections (EWS) of citizens who are not covered under Article 15(4).

### **Landmark Case: Mandal Commission Case (Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992)**

The Supreme Court upheld the 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government employment. However, it imposed several conditions:

* The creamy layer (economically well-off members of OBCs) should be excluded.
* Reservations should not exceed 50% of the total vacancies.
* Reservations should not be based on religion or caste alone.

## **Scope of Article 15**

### **What Does Article 15 Cover?**

Article 15 applies to:

* **State action:** All actions by the State and its instrumentalities
* **Education:** Educational institutions and services
* **Employment:** Public employment and services
* **Public services:** All services and benefits provided by the State
* **Facilities and opportunities:** Access to public facilities, markets, and opportunities

### **What Does Article 15 NOT Cover?**

* **Private discrimination:** Discrimination by purely private parties not acting under State authority (though this distinction is increasingly blurred)
* **Personal relations:** Discrimination in personal or family matters
* **Grounds not listed:** While Article 15 covers the listed grounds, discrimination on other grounds might be covered under Article 14

## **Landmark Cases on Article 15**

### **Champakam Dorairajan v. State of Madras (1951)**

The Supreme Court struck down a provision that provided for reservation of seats in educational institutions on a communal (caste) basis, holding that it violated Article 15(1). However, the court indicated that reservations for backward classes might be permissible under what later became Article 15(4).

### **State of Kerala v. N. M. Thomas (1976)**

The court upheld reservations for backward classes, holding that Article 15(4) permits special provisions for backward classes and does not violate Articles 14 and 15(1).

### **Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992) - Mandal Commission Case**

This landmark judgment upheld OBC reservations but imposed the 50% ceiling on total reservations and the exclusion of the creamy layer.

### **M. Nagaraj v. Union of India (2006)**

The court upheld the application of the creamy layer principle even to SC/ST reservations in government employment, recognizing that only genuinely disadvantaged members should benefit from reservations.

### **Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India (2008)**

The court upheld the validity of a 27% reservation for OBCs in centrally-funded technical institutions (like IITs and AIEEE).

## **Reasonable Restrictions Under Article 15**

### **State Security:**

The State may make reasonable classifications for security purposes. For example, different rules for foreign nationals in sensitive areas.

### **Objectively Based Distinctions:**

The State may make distinctions based on objective criteria that correlate with the purpose of the law. For example, different educational requirements for different professional qualifications.

## **Conclusion on Article 15**

Article 15 is a powerful guarantee against discrimination on specific grounds. Combined with Articles 14, 16, and 17, it forms the constitutional framework for equality and non-discrimination in India. The courts have interpreted Article 15 expansively to cover not just direct discrimination but also indirect or systemic discrimination. The balance between prohibiting discrimination and permitting positive discrimination for backward classes represents one of the key challenges in Indian constitutional jurisprudence.

# **ARTICLE 16: EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT**

## **Introduction and Text**

Article 16 of the Indian Constitution states:

"(1) There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.

(2) No citizen shall, on the ground only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in relation to, any employment or office under the State.

(3) Nothing in this article shall prevent Parliament from making any law prescribing, in relation to a matter to which the exercise of the executive power of the Union extends, any requirement as to domicile within the Union or any State or Union territory in relation to employment or office under the State.

(4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favor of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State."

## **Scope and Application**

### **Definition of "Office Under the State"**

"Office under the State" includes all posts, positions, and employment under:

* The Government of India
* The Government of any State
* Local authorities
* Public corporations and undertakings controlled by the State

### **Principle of Equal Opportunity**

The principle of equal opportunity means that:

* Every citizen has an equal right to compete for public employment.
* Selection must be based on merit and fitness.
* No citizen can be discriminated against on specified grounds.
* The selection process must be transparent and fair.

## **Prohibited Grounds of Discrimination (Article 16(2))**

Article 16(2) specifically prohibits discrimination on the following grounds:

1. **Religion:** No discrimination based on religious beliefs or practices.

2. **Race:** No discrimination based on race or ethnicity.

3. **Caste:** No discrimination based on caste or social status.

4. **Sex:** No discrimination based on gender.

5. **Descent:** No discrimination based on ancestry or family lineage.

6. **Place of Birth:** No discrimination based on where the person was born.

7. **Residence:** No discrimination based on where the person resides.

This list is broader than Article 15, adding "descent" and "residence" as protected grounds.

## **Permissible Distinctions Under Article 16**

### **Domicile Requirements (Article 16(3))**

Article 16(3) permits Parliament to make domicile requirements for employment under the Union. Similarly, States may impose domicile requirements for State employment. This is justified on the basis that:

* It ensures local control and participation in governance.
* It recognizes regional identity and administration.

However, domicile requirements must be reasonable and justified by the administrative needs of the position.

### **Reservations for Backward Classes (Article 16(4))**

Article 16(4) permits the State to make reservations for backward classes of citizens not adequately represented in public services.

**Key Principles:**

* Reservations must be for a backward class, not individuals.
* The State must have a rational basis for considering a class backward.
* Reservations cannot exceed 50% of vacancies (established in the Mandal Commission case).
* The creamy layer principle applies—well-off members of backward classes may be excluded.

### **Reservations for EWS (Article 16(6))**

Added by the 103rd Amendment Act, 2019, Article 16(6) permits reservations for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) up to 10% in public employment.

## **Types of Public Employment Covered**

Article 16 covers:

1. **Civil Services:** All-India Services, State Services, etc.
2. **Public Sector Undertakings:** Corporations and boards controlled by the State.
3. **Public Offices:** Constitutional and statutory offices.
4. **Promotion:** The article also applies to promotions within public employment.

## **Landmark Cases on Article 16**

### **Airlift Kapur v. Union of India (1960)**

The court struck down a provision that gave differential pension rights to officers of different cadres, holding that it violated Article 16 as it was based on no intelligible differentia and was purely arbitrary.

### **Air India v. Nergesh Meerza (1981)**

The court held that an airline's rule terminating the employment of female air hostesses upon marriage violated Article 16. The court recognized that while employment conditions can be prescribed, arbitrary classifications based on sex are impermissible.

### **Indira Sawhney v. Union of India (1992) - Mandal Commission Case**

This landmark judgment upheld the 27% reservation for OBCs in government employment but established the 50% ceiling on total reservations, the creamy layer exclusion, and other principles governing reservations.

### **State of Karnataka v. Rajendra (1979)**

The court held that while candidates can be grouped by qualifications or experience for different positions, arbitrary grouping to exclude certain candidates is violative of Article 16.

### **Jarnail Singh v. Union of India (2014)**

The court held that the 50% ceiling on reservations applies even when the State seeks to implement reservations in SC/ST categories, and that some vacancies should be kept open for general candidates.

## **Reasonable Restrictions on Public Employment**

### **Citizenship Requirement**

Some positions may be restricted to Indian citizens only (e.g., constitutional offices like President, Prime Minister). This is not considered discrimination under Article 16.

### **Qualifications and Merit**

The State may prescribe reasonable qualifications, educational requirements, and merit-based criteria. These are not discriminatory if they are rational and applied uniformly.

### **Experience Requirements**

The State may require minimum experience or age limits if they are justified by the nature of the position.

### **Health and Medical Requirements**

Reasonable medical or health requirements may be imposed for certain positions (e.g., medical fitness for Armed Forces personnel).

## **Promotion and Article 16**

### **Application to Promotions**

While originally focused on recruitment, courts have extended Article 16 to cover promotions within government employment.

### **Merit vs. Seniority**

Courts have held that both merit and seniority are legitimate factors in promotions, and no rigid preference for either principle violates Article 16 if applied uniformly.

### **Reservations in Promotion**

Article 16(4-A), added in 1995, permits the State to make reservations for SC/ST in matters of promotion. However, there remain debates about the applicability of the 50% ceiling to promotional reservations.

## **Recent Developments**

### **EWS Reservation (2019)**

The 103rd Amendment introduced Article 16(6) to permit 10% reservations for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). This was upheld by the Supreme Court in the EWS Reservation case (2022) against challenges that it violated the 50% ceiling and the basic feature doctrine.

## **Conclusion on Article 16**

Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in public employment, one of the most important social and economic rights for citizens. By combining the prohibition on arbitrary discrimination with the permissibility of reasonable reservations, Article 16 seeks to balance merit-based selection with the need to correct historical injustices and achieve representation of all sections of society in public services.

# **ARTICLE 17: ABOLITION OF UNTOUCHABILITY**

## **Introduction and Text**

Article 17 of the Indian Constitution states: "Untouchability is abolished, and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of Untouchability shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law."

This is one of the most significant articles of the Indian Constitution, reflecting the Constitution-makers' determination to eradicate one of the most pernicious evils of Indian society.

## **Historical Context**

Untouchability was a degrading system of social discrimination that prevailed in parts of India for centuries. Under this system, certain communities considered "untouchable" were subjected to severe restrictions on their social interaction, occupational choices, and access to public spaces. They were denied access to wells, temples, schools, and even physical contact with other communities.

Dr. Ambedkar, himself a victim of untouchability, was instrumental in incorporating this article in the Constitution. He emphasized that the abolition of untouchability was essential for human dignity and social progress.

## **Meaning and Scope**

### **What is Untouchability?**

Untouchability is a system of social organization where certain communities are excluded from normal social and economic participation on the basis of their birth. It involves:

* Denial of access to certain professions or occupations.
* Restrictions on social interaction.
* Denial of access to public facilities, temples, water sources, etc.
* Imposition of degrading practices or restrictions.
* Denial of educational or economic opportunities.

### **Complete Prohibition**

Article 17 provides a complete and absolute prohibition on the practice of untouchability in any form. This means:

* No person can practice untouchability.
* No institution can enforce or support untouchability practices.
* No State action can be based on or support untouchability.
* Any practice related to untouchability is unconstitutional.

## **Enforcement of Article 17**

### **Criminal Liability**

Article 17 specifically states that "enforcement of any disability arising out of Untouchability shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law."

The Untouchability Offences Act, 1955 (now called the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955) was enacted to enforce Article 17. This Act provides for:

* Criminal penalties for practicing untouchability.
* Civil remedies for victims.
* Special provisions for investigation and prosecution of cases.

### **The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989**

This Act provides additional protection to members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are victims of untouchability-based discrimination and violence.

## **Related Constitutional Provisions**

### **Article 15: Prohibition of Discrimination**

Article 15 complements Article 17 by prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of caste, which is closely related to untouchability practices.

### **Article 16: Equality in Public Employment**

Article 16 ensures that no citizen is discriminated against in public employment on the basis of caste, further protecting against untouchability-based discrimination.

### **Article 25: Freedom of Religion**

Article 25 provides freedom to practice religion, but this freedom is subject to limitations and cannot be used to justify untouchability practices.

## **Legal Framework to Combat Untouchability**

### **Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955**

This Act was the first legislation enacted to enforce Article 17. It includes provisions to:

* Define untouchability offences.
* Provide for investigation and prosecution.
* Provide for compensation to victims.
* Establish special procedures for adjudication.

### **Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989**

This comprehensive Act provides protection against not just untouchability but broader caste-based violence and discrimination, including:

* Social boycotts.
* Denial of access to common resources.
* Forced labour.
* Violence and torture.

## **Landmark Cases on Article 17**

### **Hari Singh v. State (1972)**

The court held that the practice of forcing a person to carry dead animals or carcasses as part of an occupation was a form of untouchability and hence violative of Article 17.

### **Sudhansu Sekhar Misra v. State of Odisha (1997)**

The court recognized that untouchability exists not just as a formal practice but also in subtle forms, including social boycotts and denial of common resources.

### **Budhadev Karmaskar v. State of West Bengal (2006)**

While primarily dealing with other issues, this judgment recognized that the abolition of untouchability is a basic feature of the Constitution that cannot be compromised.

## **Contemporary Manifestations of Untouchability**

### **Social Boycotts**

Communities continue to impose social boycotts against certain castes, denying them access to common resources, temples, and social interactions. These have been held to be forms of untouchability.

### **Occupational Restrictions**

Some communities continue to impose restrictions on occupations available to certain castes, forcing them into degrading work. These are forms of untouchability.

### **Access to Public Facilities**

Denial of access to water sources, temples, schools, and other public facilities on the basis of caste continues in some areas and is a violation of Article 17.

### **Marriage and Social Relations**

Restrictions on inter-caste marriages and denial of normal social relations are subtle forms of untouchability-based discrimination.

## **Challenges in Enforcement**

### **Social Resistance**

Despite legal prohibition, social resistance to the abolition of untouchability remains strong in many areas, making enforcement difficult.

### **Lack of Awareness**

In rural and remote areas, awareness about the illegality of untouchability practices is limited, leading to continued violations.

### **Difficulty in Proof**

Unlike formal legal violations, many untouchability practices are informal and difficult to prove in court.

### **Social Pressure Against Complainants**

Victims often face social ostracization when they report untouchability offences, discouraging formal complaints.

## **Conclusion on Article 17**

Article 17 represents the Constitution's absolute rejection of untouchability and the degrading social practices associated with it. It affirms the inherent dignity and equality of all human beings, regardless of their birth or social status. While significant progress has been made in eradicating the formal practice of untouchability, subtle and informal forms persist, requiring continued vigilance, legal enforcement, and social reform efforts. Article 17 remains not just a legal provision but a symbol of India's commitment to creating an egalitarian and just society.

# **ARTICLE 18: ABOLITION OF TITLES**

## **Introduction and Text**

Article 18 of the Indian Constitution states:

"(1) No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State.

(2) No citizen shall accept any title from a foreign State.

(3) No person who, not being a citizen of India, holds any office of profit or trust under the State, shall accept without the consent of the President, any present, emolument, or office from or under any foreign State.

(4) No citizen shall, in the absence of Presidential consent, accept any present, emolument, or office from or under any foreign State."

## **Meaning and Scope**

### **Abolition of Hereditary Titles**

The primary objective of Article 18 is to abolish the system of hereditary titles and honors that existed in pre-Independence India. The Constitution-makers sought to establish a society based on equality where no person was superior to another by virtue of birth or hereditary status.

### **Types of Distinctions Permitted**

Article 18 permits the State to confer:

* **Military Distinctions:** Honors and awards for military valor and service, such as Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, Param Vir Chakra, etc.
* **Academic Distinctions:** Honors and degrees conferred by educational institutions, such as degrees, medals, and academic honors.

## **Clause-by-Clause Analysis**

### **Clause (1): Prohibition on State Conferral of Titles**

"No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State."

This clause prohibits the State from conferring titles (not military or academic) on any person. The term "title" here refers to hereditary or honorific designations like "Raja," "Maharaja," "Khan," etc.

**Exceptions Permitted:**

* Military distinctions (e.g., Padma awards, gallantry medals)
* Academic distinctions (e.g., degrees, medals, academic honors)
* Honours based on merit and service

### **Clause (2): Prohibition on Acceptance of Foreign Titles by Citizens**

"No citizen shall accept any title from a foreign State."

This clause prevents citizens from accepting titles from foreign countries, preserving national sovereignty and preventing foreign influence on Indian citizens.

**Rationale:**

* Prevents foreign powers from creating competing loyalties.
* Protects Indian citizenship from erosion.
* Prevents creation of a foreign-backed aristocracy within India.

### **Clause (3): Foreign Office of Profit**

"No person who, not being a citizen of India, holds any office of profit or trust under the State, shall accept, without the consent of the President, any present, emolument, or office from or under any foreign State."

This clause prevents non-citizens employed by the Indian State from accepting positions or benefits from foreign governments without Presidential approval. It protects against conflicts of interest and potential espionage.

### **Clause (4): Citizens and Foreign Positions**

"No citizen shall, in the absence of Presidential consent, accept any present, emolument, or office from or under any foreign State."

This clause requires Indian citizens to obtain Presidential consent before accepting any significant position, gift, or emolument (remuneration) from a foreign government or institution.

**Purpose:**

* Prevents conflicts of interest.
* Protects against foreign influence on government officials.
* Ensures loyalty to the Indian Constitution.

## **Application and Interpretation**

### **What Constitutes a "Title"?**

The term "title" refers to:

* Hereditary designations (e.g., "Raja," "Maharaja")
* Honorific designations based on birth or status
* Noble or aristocratic titles
* Any designation that is not earned through merit or military service

**What is NOT a Title:**

* Academic degrees (B.A., M.A., Ph.D., etc.)
* Professional qualifications (Chartered Accountant, Lawyer, Doctor, etc.)
* Job titles or professional designations
* Honors based on merit and service

### **Military and Academic Distinctions**

The Constitution specifically exempts military and academic distinctions from the prohibition. This means:

* The State can confer military honors and awards.
* Universities and educational institutions can confer degrees and academic honors.
* Professional bodies can grant professional designations.

### **Evolution of Awards System**

To implement Article 18 while permitting legitimate distinctions, India has developed a comprehensive system of national awards:

**Civil Awards:**

* Bharat Ratna (highest civil honor)
* Padma Vibhushan
* Padma Bhushan
* Padma Shri

**Military Awards:**

* Param Vir Chakra
* Ashoka Chakra
* Vir Chakra
* Mahavir Chakra

These awards are not titles but rather honors recognizing exceptional service and valor.

## **Landmark Cases on Article 18**

### **Bhuwan Mohan Patnaik v. State of Odisha (2005)**

The court examined whether certain designations used in Odisha violated Article 18. The court held that designations that are purely functional and do not confer hereditary or perpetual status do not violate Article 18.

### **Sukumar Sengupta v. Government of India (2003)**

The court held that the President's discretion under Article 18(4) is not unlimited. The President must exercise this discretion reasonably and in accordance with established guidelines.

## **Foreign Titles and Indian Citizens**

### **Academic Titles from Foreign Universities**

While citizens can pursue higher education abroad and obtain degrees (which are academic distinctions), the acceptance of purely honorific or noble titles from foreign governments requires Presidential consent.

### **Peerage and Foreign Nobility**

Indian citizens cannot accept titles of peerage or nobility from foreign governments without Presidential consent. This prevents the creation of a foreign-backed aristocracy within India.

### **Diplomatic and Official Recognition**

Citizens serving in official capacities (ambassadors, diplomats, etc.) may accept honorific recognitions from foreign governments in their official capacity, but this is generally done with government knowledge and consent.

## **Contemporary Relevance**

### **National Awards and Recognition**

The Indian system of national awards respects Article 18 while providing legitimate recognition of exceptional service and achievement. The Padma awards, military decorations, and other honors fulfill the aspirations of Article 18 by recognizing merit without creating a titled aristocracy.

### **Prevention of Foreign Influence**

Article 18(2) and (4) protect against foreign influence by requiring that citizens cannot accept significant positions or benefits from foreign governments without consent. This becomes increasingly relevant in an era of growing international engagement.

## **Distinction Between Titles and Awards**

| Aspect | Title | Award/Honor |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Nature** | Hereditary or permanent designation | Recognition of achievement or service |
| **Status** | Confers elevated social status | Recognizes merit or service |
| **Transferability** | Can be inherited or transferred | Personal to the awardee |
| **Legality** | Prohibited under Article 18(1) | Permitted (military and academic) |
| **Purpose** | To establish hierarchy | To recognize excellence |

## **Conclusion on Article 18**

Article 18 represents the Constitution-makers' commitment to abolishing feudalism, hereditary privilege, and foreign influence on Indian citizens. By prohibiting titles while permitting legitimate awards and distinctions, it establishes that in a democratic republic, status and recognition must be earned through merit and service, not inherited through birth. The article remains relevant in preventing the creation of an aristocratic class and protecting national sovereignty from foreign influence.
