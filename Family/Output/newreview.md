## Problem 1: Nagaraj and Rani Marriage Dissolution

**Year:** December 2019 | **Marks:** 6

### Facts of the Case
Nagaraj and Rani solemnised marriage in July 2018. Within three months (by October 2018), they realised mutual incompatibility rendering cohabitation impossible.

### Issues Involved
1. Whether parties can immediately petition for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
2. Statutory temporal requirements for mutual consent divorce.
3. Alternative remedies available within three months of marriage.

### Relevant Legal Provisions
Section 13B(1) Hindu Marriage Act: Parties must live separately for "one year or more" before filing joint petition.

### Analysis and Reasoned Judgment
**No, they cannot dissolve marriage immediately.** Section 13B mandates one-year separation preceding petition. Three months falls substantially short. Courts strictly enforce this requirement (*Amardeep Singh v. Harveen Kaur*, 2017). No waiver exists. 

Alternative remedies unavailable: Contested divorce grounds (Section 13) require cruelty/adultery (impossible in three months); void/voidable marriage grounds (Sections 11-12) inapplicable absent constitutional defects. Judicial separation (Section 10) available but requires fault grounds.

**Judgment:** Petition premature; must wait until July 2019 for Section 13B eligibility [web:42][web:48].

## Problem 2: Father's Debt and Son's Liability

**Year:** June 2019, April/May 2022 | **Marks:** 6

### Facts of the Case
Father incurred debt for personal benefit, died. Son possesses self-acquired property.

### Issues Involved
1. Applicability of Doctrine of Pious Obligation to self-acquired property.
2. Distinction between ancestral/joint family property vs. son's separate property.
3. Effect of Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.

### Relevant Legal Provisions
Section 30-A Hindu Succession Act (inserted 2005); Mitakshara principles.

### Analysis and Reasoned Judgment
**Son NOT liable from self-acquired property.** Pious obligation binds son's interest in **joint family property only**, not self-acquired property (*Katragadda Ramayya v. Kolli Nageshwar Rao*, 1966). 

Post-2005 Amendment (Section 30-A), liability limited to **value of inherited property** from deceased father, excluding son's subsequent acquisitions. Debt for "personal benefit" (if legal) binds inherited share only; immoral debts excluded entirely.

**Judgment:** Creditor recovers from son's inherited share (if any); self-acquired property protected [web:43][web:46][web:49].

## Problem 3: Restitution Order to Divorce Ground

**Year:** April/May 2022 | **Marks:** 6

### Facts of the Case
Husband obtained restitution decree (Section 9). Wife disobeyed. Husband seeks divorce.

### Issues Involved
1. Whether non-compliance with restitution decree constitutes desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)).
2. Section 13(1A)(ii) requirements for divorce post-restitution decree.

### Relevant Legal Provisions
Section 13(1A)(ii): Divorce where restitution decree obtained but not obeyed for one year.

### Analysis and Reasoned Judgment
**Yes, husband can succeed** provided one-year non-compliance established. Section 13(1A)(ii) creates **statutory ground** post-restitution decree disobedience for one year. No need prove "desertion intent" separately.

Requirements satisfied: (1) Valid restitution decree; (2) Wife's wilful non-compliance; (3) One-year period elapsed. Courts grant divorce routinely (*Saroj Rani v. Sudarshan*, 1984).

**Judgment:** Divorce decree granted upon proof of one-year disobedience [web:65][web:68].

**Year:** January/February 2025 | **Marks:** 6

### Issues Involved
Order of succession under Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended 2005).

### Analysis and Reasoned Judgment

1. **Class I Heirs** (share equally):
   - Adopted son (full Class I heir, Section 12)
   - Daughter (coparcener post-2005 amendment)

2. **Class II** (only if no Class I): Father
3. Brother (last, shares with father if no Class I)

**Shares:** Adopted son + daughter divide estate 50:50. Father/brother excluded [web:110][web:113].

## Problem 5: Vijayalaxmi's Intestate Succession (Female)

**Year:** January/February 2025 | **Marks:** 6

### Facts of the Case
Vijayalaxmi dies intestate leaving: illegitimate daughter, son, father, mother.

### Issues Involved
Status of illegitimate daughter under Section 16 Hindu Succession Act.

### Relevant Legal Provisions
Section 16: Illegitimate children inherit from mother only.

### Analysis and Reasoned Judgment
**Distribution Order (Section 15):**
1. **Son** (Class I) - primary heir

3. Father/mother excluded

## Short Note 1: Dowry - Customary and Legislative

**Year:** June 2019, January/February 2025 | **Marks:** 6

### Customary Origins
Dowry (stridhan) originally voluntary **woman's property** given at marriage for bride's security (Manusmriti). Evolved into **groom's family demand** creating social evil.

### Legislative Framework

- Section 2: Defines dowry (any property given/demand as consideration for marriage)
- Section 3: Punishment (imprisonment + fine)
- Section 4: Demand punishable
- **IPC Section 498A**: Cruelty linked to dowry demands

**Judicial Enforcement:** Strict liability; burden on accused (*Appasaheb v. State*, 2007) [web:90][web:96].

Section 15 Hindu Marriage Act mandates **one-year waiting period** post-decree before remarriage, unless:

2. Both parties remarry each other

**Rationale:** Facilitates appeals; prevents bigamy disputes. Non-compliance: Marriage void (Section 5(i)); bigamy offence (IPC 494).

3. **Maintenance decree** + 1-year non-cohabitation (Section 125 CrPC)
