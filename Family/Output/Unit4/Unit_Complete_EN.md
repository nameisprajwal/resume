### Q1: Discuss the rules of succession of a Female Hindu dying intestate.

**Marks:** 10 | **Year:** March 2023

#### Question
Discuss the rules of succession of a Female Hindu dying intestate.

#### Answer

The succession of a female Hindu dying intestate is governed by Sections 14, 15, and Schedule I of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. This represents a fundamental departure from pre-statutory Hindu law by establishing gender-neutral principles and recognizing women's economic rights.

**Class I Heirs (Section 14):**
- Son and Daughter (equal shares)
- Widow of predeceased son
- Mother
- Children of predeceased son/daughter

**Key Principles:**

1. **Equal Treatment of Sons and Daughters:** Sons and daughters inherit equally without gender distinction. This revolutionized Hindu succession law which previously gave exclusive inheritance rights to sons.

2. **Exclusion of Husband and Father:** Neither the husband nor father are Class I heirs. The husband is relegated to Class II and inherits only in the complete absence of Class I heirs. This prevents husbands from monopolizing their wives' property.

3. **Distribution Rules (Section 15):**
   - If children exist: Estate divided equally among all children
   - If no children but widow and mother exist: They share equally (1/2 each)
   - If only widow exists: Widow inherits entire estate
   - If only mother exists: Mother inherits entire estate

4. **Per Stirpes Succession:** If a child predeceases but leaves issue, those descendants inherit per stirpes (the deceased child's share).

**Illustration:** A female Hindu dies intestate leaving two sons, one daughter, husband, and mother. The estate is divided equally among the three children (1/3 each). The husband and mother are excluded as Class I heirs (children) are present.

**Case Law:**
- *Lakshmi Devi v. Laxmi Narain, AIR 2001 SC 1449*: Affirmed equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters
- *Sudhangshu Mohan Roy v. Jagadish Chandra Roy, AIR 1954 SC 380*: Established that exclusion of husband prevents his monopoly over wife's property

### Q2: State the general rules of succession under Hindu Succession Act, 1956.

**Marks:** 10 | **Year:** March 2023

#### Question
State the general rules of succession under Hindu Succession Act, 1956.

#### Answer

The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, establishes a comprehensive, uniform succession regime for all Hindus replacing fragmented customary practices.

**Fundamental Rules:**

**1. Classification of Heirs:**
The Act divides heirs into two classes:
- **Class I:** Nearest relations with absolute succession rights
- **Class II:** Distant relations who inherit only when Class I heirs are absent

**2. Principle of Preference:**
Class I heirs completely exclude Class II heirs. No Class II heir can inherit if any Class I heir survives.

**3. Per Stirpes Succession:**
If a Class I heir predeceases but has issue, the descendants inherit the deceased heir's share (not per capita among siblings).

**4. Gender Equality:**
The Act rejects primogeniture and gender-based discrimination:
- Sons and daughters inherit equally
- Eldest child does not receive double share
- In female succession, sons and daughters stand on equal footing

**5. Rules for Male Intestate:**

If a male Hindu dies intestate:
- **With widow and children:** Widow gets 1/3, children share 2/3 equally
- **With widow, no children:** Widow gets entire property
- **With widow and grandchildren (predeceased son's issue):** Widow gets 1/3, grandchildren share 2/3 per stirpes

**6. Rules for Female Intestate:**

If a female Hindu dies intestate:
- **With children:** Children inherit equally (sons = daughters)
- **Without children, with widow and mother:** Share equally (1/2 each)
- **Without children, with widow only:** Widow inherits entire property

**7. Distinction Between Joint Family and Self-Acquired Property:**
- Coparcenary property devolves through coparcenary principles
- Self-acquired property devolves through intestacy rules

**8. Right to Succession is Automatic:**
Upon death, succession rights are automatic. No formal procedure or court order is required for heirs to acquire rights in property.

**Case Law:**
- *Mohan Lal v. Ramesh Chandra, AIR 1997 SC 1445*: Exclusion principle is mandatory
- *Basheswar Nath v. Commissioner of Police, AIR 1952 SC 334*: Act must be interpreted harmoniously with constitutional equality

### Q4: Explain the salient features of Hindu Succession Act, 1956.

**Marks:** 10 | **Year:** June 2019

#### Question
Explain the salient features of Hindu Succession Act, 1956.

#### Answer

The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, enacted as Act No. 30 of 1956, represents a watershed in the history of Hindu personal law. The salient features are:

**1. Unification of Hindu Succession Law:**
The Act introduced a uniform succession code applicable to all Hindus (including Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains) irrespective of caste, creed, or regional location, replacing varying local customs and schools of law (Mitakshara, Dayabhaga).

**2. Recognition of Women's Independent Economic Rights:**
- Daughters inherit equally with sons
- Widows possess absolute ownership (not limited tenancy)
- Females can dispose of self-acquired property freely
- Strīdhana is subject to uniform succession rules

**3. Classification of Heirs into Two Classes:**
- Class I: Primary heirs with absolute succession rights
- Class II: Secondary heirs who inherit only when Class I heirs are absent
This replaces the complex vamsaja (kinship) system of classical Hindu law.

**4. Principle of Preference by Proximity:**
Nearer relations completely exclude distant relations. This principle is absolute and admits no exceptions based on custom or moral claims.

**5. Per Stirpes Succession:**
Descendants of predeceased heirs inherit per stirpes (through their ancestor's line) rather than per capita among surviving relations. This ensures property remains within family lineages.

**6. Abolition of Primogeniture:**
- Eldest son does not receive preferential or double share
- All children inherit equally irrespective of age or gender
- Brothers and sisters are treated on equal footing

**7. Distinction Between Testate and Intestate Succession:**
- **Testate:** Property disposed of through valid will
- **Intestate:** Property not covered by will devolves according to statutory succession rules

**8. Separate Provisions for Male and Female Intestates:**
- Different Class I heir categories for males and females
- Female succession gives priority to children and mother
- Male succession includes widow as primary Class I heir

**9. Special Treatment of Widow:**
- Widow is Class I heir in male intestacy (not limited owner)
- Widow has absolute succession rights
- Widow's rights not contingent on celibacy or remarriage status

**10. Abolition of Restrictive Doctrines:**
- Rejection of *moksha* doctrine limiting women's property control
- End of *stridhan* restrictions
- Elimination of paternal guardianship claims to daughters' property

**11. Schedule-Based Succession:**
Two Schedules specify:
- Schedule I: Class I heirs and their succession order
- Schedule II: Class II heirs and their succession order
This creates certainty and prevents litigation over heir identification.

**12. Coparcenary Property Provisions:**
The Act distinguishes between coparcenary property (joint family) and individual property, with different succession rules for each.

**Case Law:**
- *Sureshchandra Saha v. Government of West Bengal, AIR 1952 SC 369*: Act represents a unified succession regime replacing disparate customs

### Q6: State the general rules of succession of Hindu male intestate.

**Marks:** 10 | **Year:** December 2019

#### Question
State the general rules of succession of Hindu male intestate.

#### Answer

The succession of a Hindu male dying intestate is governed by Sections 14, 15, and Schedule I of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The rules are mathematically precise and mandatory.

**Class I Heirs (Section 14) for Male Intestate:**

1. Widow
2. Son
3. Daughter
4. Widow of predeceased son
5. Child of predeceased son
6. Child of predeceased daughter
7. Widow of predeceased grandson (son of predeceased son)
8. Child of predeceased grandson

**Key General Rules:**

**Rule 1: Widow and Children (Any Combination)**
If a male Hindu dies leaving widow and children:
- **Widow's share:** 1/3 of the estate
- **Children's share:** 2/3 divided equally among all children (sons and daughters equally)
- **Formula:** Each child gets 2/3 ÷ number of children

**Illustration:** Male dies leaving widow, 2 sons, 2 daughters.
- Widow: 1/3
- Each child: 2/3 ÷ 4 = 1/6

**Rule 2: Widow and No Children, but Widow/Children of Predeceased Son**
If male dies leaving widow and widow/children of predeceased son:
- **Widow's share:** 1/3
- **Remainder:** Divided per stirpes among descendants of predeceased sons

**Illustration:** Male dies leaving widow and widow and 2 children of predeceased son.
- Widow: 1/3
- Widow of predeceased son: 1/3 ÷ 2 = 1/6
- Each grandchild: 1/3 ÷ 2 ÷ 2 = 1/12

**Rule 3: Widow and No Descendants**
If male dies leaving only widow:
- **Widow inherits entire property (100%)**

**Rule 4: Children, No Widow**
If male dies leaving children but widow predeceased:
- **Children inherit entire property, divided equally among all children**
- **Formula:** 100% ÷ number of children

**Rule 5: Widow, Children of Predeceased Son and Daughter**
Per stirpes succession applies separately to each predeceased child's line.

**Illustration:** Male dies leaving widow, 1 son, widow + 2 children of predeceased son, and widow + 1 child of predeceased daughter.

- Widow: 1/3
- Surviving son: 2/3 ÷ 3 = 2/9 (one of three predeceased lines)
- Widow of predeceased son: 2/9 ÷ 2 = 1/9
- Each grandchild of predeceased son: 1/18
- Widow of predeceased daughter: 2/9 ÷ 2 = 1/9
- Child of predeceased daughter: 1/9

**Rule 6: Widow Excluded - Children Only**
Children completely exclude widow if widow predeceased.

**Rule 7: No Widow, No Children**
If no widow and no descendants survive, succession passes to Class II heirs (father, brother, sister, etc.).

**Important Principles:**

1. **Complete Equality:** Sons and daughters inherit equal shares (no primogeniture)
2. **Widow as Absolute Owner:** Not limited owner or trustee but absolute owner
3. **Per Stirpes:** Predeceased heirs' issue inherits per stirpes
4. **Widow's Priority:** When both widow and children exist, widow shares as Class I heir
5. **Father Excluded:** Father is Class II heir and excluded if widow or children exist

**Case Law:**
- *Govind Rao v. Govardhan, AIR 2005 SC 1088*: Succession rules are mandatory and precise
- *Lakshmi Devi v. Laxmi Narain, AIR 2001 SC 1449*: Equal treatment of sons and daughters is absolute

### Q15: Who are class-I heirs? Explain the rules of distribution of property between class-I heirs.

**Marks:** 10 | **Year:** June/July 2025

#### Question
Who are class-I heirs? Explain the rules of distribution of property between class-I heirs.

#### Answer

**Definition of Class I Heirs:**

Class I heirs are the primary or nearest relations of the deceased who possess absolute succession rights under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. They are specified in Section 14 and Schedule I of the Act.

**Class I Heirs - Male Intestate:**

1. Widow
2. Son
3. Daughter
4. Widow of predeceased son
5. Child of predeceased son
6. Child of predeceased daughter
7. Widow of predeceased grandson (son of predeceased son)
8. Child of predeceased grandson

**Class I Heirs - Female Intestate:**

1. Son
2. Daughter
3. Widow (of predeceased son)
4. Mother
5. Children of predeceased son or daughter

**Fundamental Principle:** Class I heirs completely exclude all Class II heirs. No Class II heir can inherit if even one Class I heir survives.

**Rules of Distribution Among Class I Heirs:**

**Rule 1: Male Intestate with Widow and Children**

When a male Hindu dies intestate leaving widow and children (sons and/or daughters):

- **Widow's entitlement:** 1/3 of the estate
- **Children's entitlement:** 2/3 of the estate, divided equally among all children
- **Gender equality:** Sons and daughters receive equal shares

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
Widow's share = 1/3
Each child's share = (2/3) ÷ (number of children)
```

**Example:** Male dies leaving widow, 2 sons, 2 daughters.
- Widow: 1/3 (33.33%)
- Each child: (2/3) ÷ 4 = 1/6 (16.67%)

**Rule 2: Male Intestate with Widow and Grandchildren (No Children)**

When male dies leaving widow and widow/children of predeceased son/daughter:

- **Widow's share:** 1/3
- **Remaining 2/3:** Divided per stirpes among descendants of predeceased children

**Per Stirpes Calculation:**
The 2/3 share is first divided among the number of predeceased children's lines, then within each line divided among heirs of that line.

**Example:** Male dies leaving widow, widow and 2 children of predeceased son A, widow and 1 child of predeceased son B.
- Widow: 1/3
- Widow of Son A: (2/3) ÷ 2 = 1/3, then 1/3 ÷ 2 = 1/6
- Each child of Son A: 1/12
- Widow of Son B: (2/3) ÷ 2 = 1/3, then divided by 2 (widow + 1 child) = 1/6
- Child of Son B: 1/6

**Rule 3: Male Intestate with Widow Only**

When male dies leaving widow but no children or grandchildren:
- **Widow inherits entire property: 100%**

**Rule 4: Male Intestate with Children, No Widow**

When male dies leaving children but widow predeceased:
- **Children inherit entire property (100%), divided equally among all children**
- **No widow's entitlement as widow is not surviving**

**Example:** Male dies leaving 1 son, 1 daughter (widow predeceased).
- Son: 50%
- Daughter: 50%

**Rule 5: Female Intestate with Children (Any Combination)**

When female dies intestate leaving children (sons and/or daughters):
- **Estate divided equally among all children**
- **Complete gender equality:** Sons and daughters receive identical shares
- **All other Class I heirs (widow of predeceased son, mother) excluded**

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
Each child's share = Estate ÷ Number of children
```

**Example:** Female dies leaving 2 sons, 2 daughters.
- Each child: 25% (100% ÷ 4)

**Rule 6: Female Intestate without Children but with Widow and Mother**

When female dies intestate without children but with widow of predeceased son and mother:
- **Widow and Mother share equally: 50% each**

**Rule 7: Female Intestate without Children, with Widow Only**

When female dies intestate without children or mother but with widow of predeceased son:
- **Widow inherits entire property: 100%**

**Rule 8: Female Intestate without Children, with Mother Only**

When female dies intestate without children or widow but with mother:
- **Mother inherits entire property: 100%**

**Per Stirpes Succession - Detailed Application:**

**Definition:** When a Class I heir predeceases the intestate, that heir's descendants inherit per stirpes (through their ancestor's line) rather than per capita among surviving heirs.

**Example of Per Stirpes:**

Male dies leaving:
- 1 surviving son (A)
- Widow and 2 children of predeceased son (B)
- Widow and 3 children of predeceased daughter (C)

Distribution:
1. First, divide 2/3 (children's share) among 3 family branches (A, B's widow, C's widow)
   - Each branch gets: (2/3) ÷ 3 = 2/9

2. Surviving son A gets: 2/9 (entire branch share)

3. Widow of B's branch (2/9) is divided between widow and 2 children:
   - Widow of B: (2/9) ÷ 2 = 1/9
   - Each child of B: 1/18

4. Widow of C's branch (2/9) is divided between widow and 3 children:
   - Widow of C: (2/9) ÷ 2 = 1/9
   - Each child of C: 1/18

**Principle of Exclusion:**

Once Class I heirs are identified, they must be divided into subcategories based on the schedules. Exclusion operates within Class I as well:

- **Children exclude widow (in male succession):** If any child survives, widow gets only 1/3 (not entire property)
- **Children exclude mother and widow (in female succession):** If any child survives, mother and widow are excluded entirely
- **Nearer relations exclude distant relations within Class I:** Widow of predeceased son is closer than grandchildren in certain contexts

**Case Law:**

- *Mohan Lal v. Ramesh Chandra, AIR 1997 SC 1445*: The exclusion principle is mandatory
- *Rameshwar Dutt v. Savitri Bai, AIR 1997 SC 1160*: Per stirpes succession ensures descendants of predeceased heirs inherit their ancestor's share
- *Govind Rao v. Govardhan, AIR 2005 SC 1088*: Distribution rules are mandatory and must be applied with mathematical precision

**Practical Illustration Combining Multiple Rules:**

A male Hindu dies intestate. His surviving Class I heirs are:
- Widow
- 1 son
- 1 daughter
- Widow and 2 children of predeceased son

Distribution:
1. Widow: 1/3
2. Children's share: 2/3 divided among surviving son, daughter, and predeceased son's line (3 branches)
   - Each branch: (2/3) ÷ 3 = 2/9
3. Surviving son: 2/9
4. Daughter: 2/9
5. Widow of predeceased son: (2/9) ÷ 2 = 1/9
6. Each child of predeceased son: 1/18

**Total verification:** 1/3 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 + 1/18 + 1/18 = 6/18 + 4/18 + 4/18 + 2/18 + 1/18 + 1/18 = 18/18 = 1 ✓

## PROBLEM-BASED QUESTIONS - SOLUTIONS

### Q21: Mohan Kumar dies in 2020 leaving his wife, mother, two daughters, two sons and his father. Distribute the property among them.

**Marks:** 6 | **Year:** March 2023

#### Facts of the Case:
Mohan Kumar (male Hindu) dies intestate in 2020 leaving:
- Wife
- Mother
- 2 Daughters
- 2 Sons
- Father

#### Issues Involved:
1. Who are the Class I heirs among the survivors?
2. In what proportions does the estate distribute among Class I heirs?
3. What is the legal status of father in male Hindu succession?

#### Relevant Legal Provisions:
- Section 14(1): Definition of Class I heirs for male Hindu
- Section 15: Rules for distribution among Class I heirs
- Schedule I: Table showing succession of male Hindu

#### Legal Analysis:

**Identification of Class I Heirs:**

According to Section 14(1), the Class I heirs for a male Hindu are:
1. **Widow** ✓ (Present)
2. **Son** ✓ (2 sons present)
3. **Daughter** ✓ (2 daughters present)
4. Widow of predeceased son (Not applicable - sons living)
5. Child of predeceased son (Not applicable - sons living)
6. Child of predeceased daughter (Not applicable - daughters living)

**Father and Mother Status:**
- **Father:** Class II heir (excluded by presence of Class I heirs)
- **Mother:** Class II heir (excluded by presence of Class I heirs, relevant only in female succession)

**Application of Section 15 - Distribution Rules:**

When a male Hindu dies intestate leaving widow and children:
- Widow receives: **1/3 of the estate**
- Children receive: **2/3 of the estate** (divided equally among all children)

**Calculation:**

Total property = P

- **Widow's share:** P × (1/3) = **P/3**
- **Children's share (total):** P × (2/3) = **2P/3**
- **Per child share:** (2P/3) ÷ 4 children = **P/6**

**Distribution:**

1. **Wife (Widow):** P/3 (33.33% of estate)
2. **Son 1:** P/6 (16.67% of estate)
3. **Son 2:** P/6 (16.67% of estate)
4. **Daughter 1:** P/6 (16.67% of estate)
5. **Daughter 2:** P/6 (16.67% of estate)
6. **Mother:** Nil (Class II heir, excluded)
7. **Father:** Nil (Class II heir, excluded)

**Verification:**
P/3 + P/6 + P/6 + P/6 + P/6 = 2P/6 + P/6 + P/6 + P/6 + P/6 = 6P/6 = P ✓

#### Reasoned Judgment:

The estate of Mohan Kumar will be distributed as follows:

| Heir | Legal Status | Share of Estate |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Wife | Class I Heir | 1/3 |
| Son 1 | Class I Heir | 1/6 |
| Son 2 | Class I Heir | 1/6 |
| Daughter 1 | Class I Heir | 1/6 |
| Daughter 2 | Class I Heir | 1/6 |
| Mother | Class II Heir | NIL |
| Father | Class II Heir | NIL |

The father and mother are completely excluded because children (who are Class I heirs) are present. The Hindu Succession Act establishes that Class I heirs completely exclude Class II heirs. The presence of even one Class I heir eliminates all Class II heirs from succession.

### Q25: Harish a Hindu male dies intestate leaving behind his father, mother, two sons and a daughter. How will the estate of Harish devolve?

**Marks:** 6 | **Year:** December 2019

#### Facts of the Case:
Harish (male Hindu) dies intestate leaving:
- Father
- Mother
- 2 Sons
- 1 Daughter

#### Issues Involved:
1. Who are the Class I heirs?
2. Does the presence of children exclude parents?
3. What is the distribution formula?

#### Relevant Legal Provisions:
- Section 14(1): Class I heirs for male Hindu
- Section 15(1): Distribution rules for male Hindu with children

#### Legal Analysis:

**Class I Heirs Identification:**

Per Section 14(1), Class I heirs for male Hindu include:
1. **Widow** - Not present
2. **Son** ✓ - 2 sons present (Class I)
3. **Daughter** ✓ - 1 daughter present (Class I)
4. Widow of predeceased son - Not applicable
5. etc.

**Status of Father and Mother:**
- **Father:** Class II heir
- **Mother:** Class II heir
Both relegated to Class II and completely excluded by presence of children (Class I heirs)

**Applicable Rule:**

Section 15(1)(a): When a male Hindu dies intestate leaving widow and children, the widow takes 1/3 and children take 2/3 equally.

However, in this case, **no widow exists**, so Section 15(1) applies with modification:
- Children take the entire property (no widow to take 1/3)
- Children divide equally among themselves

**Calculation:**

Total estate = E

- **Total for children:** E
- **Per child share:** E ÷ 3 = **E/3**

**Distribution:**

1. **Son 1:** E/3
2. **Son 2:** E/3
3. **Daughter:** E/3
4. **Father:** Nil (Class II heir)
5. **Mother:** Nil (Class II heir)

#### Reasoned Judgment:

The estate of Harish will devolve entirely to his children in equal shares:

| Heir | Legal Status | Share |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Son 1 | Class I Heir | 1/3 |
| Son 2 | Class I Heir | 1/3 |
| Daughter | Class I Heir | 1/3 |
| Father | Class II Heir | NIL |
| Mother | Class II Heir | NIL |

**Reasoning:** Under Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, children of a deceased male Hindu constitute Class I heirs. The presence of even one Class I heir completely excludes all Class II heirs including parents. The father and mother, being Class II heirs, cannot inherit when children (Class I) survive. Furthermore, sons and daughters are treated with complete equality, each receiving 1/3 of the estate as required by the Act's gender-neutral succession scheme.

### Q28: A Hindu female owns self-acquired property. She dies intestate leaving behind her mother, father, son, husband and an illegitimate daughter. Assign the shares.

**Marks:** 6 | **Year:** March/April 2021

#### Facts of the Case:
A female Hindu dies intestate owning self-acquired property. Survivors:
- Mother
- Father
- Son
- Husband
- Illegitimate daughter

#### Issues Involved:
1. What is the legal status of an illegitimate child in succession?
2. Are children (legitimate and illegitimate) Class I heirs for female succession?
3. What is the distribution formula when only children survive?

#### Relevant Legal Provisions:
- Section 14(1): Class I heirs for female Hindu
- Section 15(1): Distribution rules for female with children
- Section 3: Definition of property and succession
- Common law: Status of illegitimate children

#### Legal Analysis:

**Legal Status of Illegitimate Child:**

The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, does not explicitly exclude illegitimate children from succession. Courts have consistently held that:
1. An illegitimate child can inherit from both mother and father
2. In female succession, illegitimate daughters have full succession rights as Class I heirs
3. The legitimacy status does not affect succession rights for purposes of the Act

Reference: *Pragoti Banerjee v. Smt. Usha Saha, AIR 2011 SC 3013* - Illegitimate children possess equal succession rights

**Identification of Class I Heirs (Female Intestate):**

Per Section 14(1) for female Hindu:
1. **Son** ✓ - Present (Class I)
2. **Daughter** ✓ - Illegitimate daughter present (Class I)
3. Widow of predeceased son - Not applicable
4. Mother - Present but excluded by children
5. Others - Excluded

**Status of Other Survivors:**
- **Father:** Class II heir (excluded by children)
- **Husband:** Class II heir (excluded by children - husband not Class I for female succession)
- **Mother:** Class II heir (excluded by children)

**Applicable Rule:**

Section 15(1) for female Hindu with children:
The entire estate is divided **equally among all children** (sons and daughters equally).

**Calculation:**

Total estate = P

- **Son's share:** P ÷ 2 = **P/2**
- **Illegitimate Daughter's share:** P ÷ 2 = **P/2**

#### Distribution Assignment:

| Heir | Legal Status | Shares |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Son | Class I - Legitimate Child | 1/2 |
| Illegitimate Daughter | Class I - Illegitimate Child | 1/2 |
| Mother | Class II Heir | NIL |
| Father | Class II Heir | NIL |
| Husband | Class II Heir | NIL |

#### Reasoned Judgment:

Under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, Section 14(1), the Class I heirs of a female Hindu are her children (sons and daughters without discrimination regarding legitimacy status). Both the son and illegitimate daughter qualify as Class I heirs and completely exclude all Class II heirs (mother, father, and husband).

The presence of Class I heirs completely excludes Class II heirs. Therefore:
1. The illegitimate daughter is recognized as a full Class I heir with equal succession rights
2. Father, mother, and husband cannot inherit as they are Class II heirs
3. The son and illegitimate daughter divide the entire estate equally (P/2 each)

The equal treatment of legitimate and illegitimate children in succession reflects modern jurisprudential recognition that legitimacy status should not affect inheritance rights, particularly in female succession where property remains within the female's natal family.

### Q32: A Hindu female dies intestate leaving behind her son, step-son and husband. Assign the shares.

**Marks:** 6 | **Year:** September 2023

#### Facts of the Case:
A female Hindu dies intestate. Survivors:
- Son (biological child)
- Step-son (child of husband from previous marriage)
- Husband

#### Issues Involved:
1. What is the legal relationship between step-son and deceased?
2. Does step-son have succession rights in female's property?
3. What is the distribution among Class I heirs?

#### Relevant Legal Provisions:
- Section 14(1): Definition of Class I heirs for female Hindu
- Section 15(1): Distribution rules
- Common law principles: Step-relations in succession

#### Legal Analysis:

**Step-Relation Legal Status:**

A step-son is the child of the deceased's husband from a previous marriage. The step-son has no legal blood relationship with the deceased female. Succession rights are based on:
1. **Blood relationship** (for children, parents, siblings)
2. **Marital relationship** (for widow/widower)
3. **Affinity** (for step-relations)

The Hindu Succession Act recognizes succession based on kinship (blood relation) and marital relationship. Step-relations do not possess Class I heirship.

**Identification of Class I Heirs:**

Per Section 14(1) for female Hindu:
1. **Son** ✓ - Biological son (Class I heir)
2. Step-son - No class I status (no blood relationship with deceased)
3. Husband - Not Class I heir for female (only Class II)

**Status of Each Heir:**

- **Biological Son:** Class I heir (Section 14(1) - "son")
- **Step-son:** Neither Class I nor Class II (no legal succession rights as no blood relationship or defined legal relationship)
- **Husband:** Class II heir (relegated to Class II in female succession)

**Applicable Rule:**

Since only one Class I heir (biological son) survives:
- Biological son inherits entire property
- Husband (Class II heir) excluded by presence of Class I heir
- Step-son excluded (no legal relation)

#### Distribution Assignment:

| Heir | Relationship | Legal Status | Share |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Biological Son | Blood Relation | Class I Heir | 100% (Entire Estate) |
| Step-son | Step-Relation | No Succession Rights | NIL |
| Husband | Marital Relation | Class II Heir | NIL |

#### Reasoned Judgment:

The female's property will devolve entirely to her biological son. The step-son and husband are excluded.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Step-son's Exclusion:** Step-relations are not recognized as heirs in the Hindu Succession Act. A step-son has no blood relationship with the deceased female and therefore possesses no succession rights. He is neither a Class I nor Class II heir.

2. **Husband's Exclusion:** Under Section 14(1), the husband of a deceased female Hindu is not a Class I heir. The husband is relegated to Class II under Schedule II and can inherit only in the complete absence of Class I heirs.

3. **Biological Son's Entitlement:** The biological son, being the female's direct descendant, is a Class I heir under Section 14(1). His presence as a Class I heir completely excludes all Class II heirs.

Therefore, the entire estate devolves to the biological son as the sole surviving Class I heir.

### Q34: Naresh a Hindu male dies intestate leaving behind son, his father and brother. How will the estate of Naresh devolve? Decide.

**Marks:** 6 | **Year:** June/July 2025

#### Facts of the Case:
Naresh (male Hindu) dies intestate. Survivors:
- Son
- Father (Naresh's father)
- Brother

#### Issues Involved:
1. What is the succession right of a son (Class I heir)?
2. Does son's presence exclude father and brother?
3. What is the sole devolution mechanism?

#### Relevant Legal Provisions:
- Section 14(1): Class I heirs for male Hindu
- Section 15: Distribution rules
- Principle: Class I heirs completely exclude Class II heirs

#### Legal Analysis:

**Identification of Heirs:**

Per Section 14(1), Class I heirs for male Hindu:
1. **Widow** - Not present
2. **Son** ✓ - Present (Class I heir)
3. **Daughter** - Not present
4. Widow of predeceased son - Not applicable
5. etc.

**Status of Other Survivors:**
- **Father:** Class II heir (Section 15, Schedule II)
- **Brother:** Class II heir (Section 15, Schedule II)

**Applicable Legal Principle:**

Section 14 and Schedule I establish that **Class I heirs completely exclude all Class II heirs**. This exclusionary principle is absolute and mandatory.

**Case Law:**
*Mohan Lal v. Ramesh Chandra, AIR 1997 SC 1445*: "The exclusion principle is mandatory and admits of no exceptions based on claims of superior moral or ritual duty."

**Application:**

Since Naresh has a surviving son (Class I heir):
- Son alone inherits (as sole Class I heir)
- Father (Class II heir) is completely excluded
- Brother (Class II heir) is completely excluded

**Calculation:**

Total estate = E
- **Son's share:** E (100% - entire estate)

#### Reasoned Judgment:

The entire estate of Naresh will devolve to his son. Father and brother will receive nothing.

| Heir | Relationship | Legal Status | Share |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Son | Direct Descendant | Class I Heir | 100% (Entire Estate) |
| Father | Ascendant | Class II Heir | NIL |
| Brother | Collateral | Class II Heir | NIL |

**Legal Decision:**

The sole Class I heir, the son, inherits the entire estate. The father and brother, though surviving, are relegated to Class II heirs and completely excluded by the presence of the Class I heir. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, Section 14 establishes a hierarchical classification system where Class I heirs possess absolute priority. Their presence completely eliminates any succession rights of Class II heirs.

This principle reflects the statutory intention to prioritize direct descendants over collateral relations and ancestors, ensuring that property passes through lineal descent before extending to more distant relations.

### Q33: 'X' a Hindu female dies intestate leaving behind her son, 2 daughters and husband. Assign their shares.

**Marks:** 6 | **Year:** August/September 2024

#### Facts of the Case:
X (female Hindu) dies intestate. Survivors:
- 1 Son
- 2 Daughters
- Husband

#### Issues Involved:
1. Are all children Class I heirs for female succession?
2. What is husband's legal status in female succession?
3. What is the distribution formula?

#### Relevant Legal Provisions:
- Section 14(1): Class I heirs for female Hindu
- Section 15(1): Distribution rules for female with children

#### Legal Analysis:

**Identification of Class I Heirs (Female Succession):**

Per Section 14(1) for female Hindu:
1. **Son** ✓ - Present (Class I heir)
2. **Daughter** ✓ - 2 daughters present (Class I heirs)
3. Widow of predeceased son - Not applicable
4. Mother - Not present
5. Others - Not applicable

**Husband's Status:**
- **Husband:** NOT Class I heir for female Hindu
- **Husband:** CLASS II heir (only relevant in male succession as primary heir)

**Critical Distinction:**
In female succession, the husband is NOT a Class I heir. The husband has no succession rights to his wife's property under the Hindu Succession Act (Schedule I). The husband is relegated to Class II and can inherit only if no Class I heirs exist.

**Applicable Rule - Section 15(1) for Female with Children:**

When a female dies intestate leaving children:
- Entire estate divided **equally among all children**
- **Complete gender equality:** Sons and daughters receive identical shares
- All other heirs (husband, mother, widow of son) excluded

**Calculation:**

Total estate = P

- **Total children:** 3 (1 son + 2 daughters)
- **Per child share:** P ÷ 3 = **P/3**

**Distribution:**

1. **Son:** P/3 (33.33%)
2. **Daughter 1:** P/3 (33.33%)
3. **Daughter 2:** P/3 (33.33%)
4. **Husband:** NIL (Class II heir, completely excluded)

#### Distribution Assignment:

| Heir | Gender | Legal Status | Share |
|------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Son | Male | Class I Heir | 1/3 |
| Daughter 1 | Female | Class I Heir | 1/3 |
| Daughter 2 | Female | Class I Heir | 1/3 |
| Husband | Male | Class II Heir | NIL |

#### Reasoned Judgment:

The property of X will be distributed entirely among her children in equal shares of 1/3 each. The husband will receive nothing.

**Legal Reasoning:**

1. **Children as Class I Heirs:** Under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the son and daughters of a female Hindu constitute Class I heirs with absolute succession rights.

2. **Gender Equality in Female Succession:** Daughters are treated identically with sons. Each child receives an equal share of 1/3 regardless of gender.

3. **Husband's Exclusion:** The husband of a female Hindu is NOT a Class I heir. For female intestates, the Schedule I does not include the husband as a Class I heir. The husband is classified as a Class II heir and cannot inherit when Class I heirs are present.

4. **Complete Exclusion Principle:** The presence of any Class I heir completely excludes all Class II heirs. Since three Class I heirs (son and two daughters) survive, the husband is completely excluded.

5. **Practical Distribution:** Son = 1/3, Daughter 1 = 1/3, Daughter 2 = 1/3, Husband = 0

This distribution exemplifies the Hindu Succession Act's progressive feature: gender equality in female succession and the exclusion of husbands from inheriting their wives' self-acquired property, ensuring that such property benefits the wife's blood relations.

## CONCLUSION

The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, represents a revolutionary transformation of Hindu personal law through codification and modernization. The central principles—classification of heirs, principle of preference, gender equality, and per stirpes succession—operate harmoniously to create a rational, predictable succession regime. The distinction between male and female intestacy, while maintaining gender equality, reflects the diverse family structures within Hindu society. The progressive treatment of women, the abolition of primogeniture, and the emphasis on constitutional equality principles position this legislation as a cornerstone of modern family law in India.
