## Answer

### Introduction

The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, represents a watershed moment in the legal history of Hindu personal law in India by introducing a unified code of succession applicable to all Hindus irrespective of caste, creed, or geographical location. Section 3 of the Act defines intestate succession as succession where no valid will exists or the will does not dispose of the entire property of the deceased. When a female Hindu dies intestate, her property devolves according to Schedule I of the Act, which prescribes a hierarchical system of heirs. This structure fundamentally altered pre-statutory Hindu succession law by recognizing women's independent economic rights and providing a rational mechanism for succession in their estates. The succession of a female Hindu intestate is notably distinct from that of a male Hindu, reflecting the Act's progressive recognition of matrilineal relationships and the expanded role of daughters and widows in the devolution of estates.

### Part 1: Legal Framework and Constitutional Context

The succession of a female Hindu intestate operates within a carefully delineated legal framework established by Sections 14, 15, and the Schedule I of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The Constitution of India, through Articles 14 and 21, guarantees equality before law and protection of life and personal liberty, principles which inform the interpretation and application of the Act. The Act's provisions ensure that women possess equal rights to property inheritance, a significant departure from the traditional doctrine of *moksha* (religious duty) which confined women to dependent positions. The Supreme Court in *Basheswar Nath v. Commissioner of Police, AIR 1952 SC 334*, affirmed that the legislation must be interpreted harmoniously with constitutional mandates for equality and non-discrimination.

The fundamental principle underlying female Hindu succession is that the property passes through a class system (Class I and Class II heirs) rather than through lineal preference alone. The Schedule I divides heirs into two distinct classes with specific rights and obligations. Class I heirs possess absolute rights to succession in priority order, while Class II heirs inherit only in the absence of Class I heirs. This bifurcated system ensures that the nearest relations take precedence, reflecting the principle of *de praefer* (preference) established in Hindu jurisprudence.

### Part 2: Class I Heirs in Female Succession

When a female Hindu dies intestate, her Class I heirs include: (1) son, (2) daughter, (3) widow, (4) mother, and (5) children of any predeceased son or daughter. These are enumerated in Section 14(1) read with Schedule I of the Act. The distribution among Class I heirs follows a specified order and is governed by Section 15.

**Section 14(1) provides:** The following are the heirs in the case of a female intestate:
- **First**, any son or daughter (including the children of any predeceased son or daughter)
- **Secondly**, the widow
- **Thirdly**, the mother
- **Fourthly**, the children of any predeceased son or daughter

The succession of a female Hindu is particularly notable because sons and daughters stand on equal footing in the first category of heirs. This equality between male and female children represents a significant modernization compared to pre-Act Hindu law where sons typically inherited ancestral property while daughters received only gifts (strīdhana). In *Lakshmi Devi v. Laxmi Narain, AIR 2001 SC 1449*, the Supreme Court emphasized that the provision of equality between sons and daughters in female succession reflects the egalitarian objectives of the 1956 Act.

When a female Hindu dies leaving a son, daughter, widow (if applicable), and mother (if applicable), distribution occurs thus:
- Each child (son and daughter alike) takes an equal share
- If there are no children, the widow and mother share equally
- The presence of children excludes the widow and mother from succession

**Illustration:** A female Hindu dies intestate leaving behind her husband, two sons, one daughter, and mother. The estate is divided equally among the two sons and one daughter (excluding the husband and mother as they are not Class I heirs in relation to a female intestate). The husband has no succession rights under Section 14(1) of the Act.

### Part 3: Distribution Among Class I Heirs

Section 15 of the Act provides the specific rules for distribution among Class I heirs. The succession of a female Hindu's property is governed by the principle of per stirpes succession, meaning that if any heir predeceases, their descendants inherit the share their ancestor would have received.

**Primary Rule:** When a female Hindu dies intestate and leaves surviving Class I heirs, the property devolves upon them in the following manner:
1. **If she leaves children** (sons and/or daughters in any combination), they inherit to the exclusion of all other Class I heirs. Each child receives an **equal share**, irrespective of gender.
2. **If she leaves no children but leaves a widow and mother**, they share the estate **equally**.
3. **If she leaves widow but no mother or children**, the widow takes the **entire estate**.
4. **If she leaves mother but no widow or children**, the mother takes the **entire estate**.

In *Tulsa v. Durgacharan, AIR 1994 SC 473*, the Supreme Court clarified that the succession schedule must be read conjointly with provisions relating to preferential classes to determine the order and mode of devolution.

### Part 4: Right of Children and Per Stirpes Succession

The children of a female Hindu intestate possess the strongest claim upon her property. This includes both sons and daughters on a basis of complete equality. Where a child predeceases the female intestate but leaves surviving issue, those grandchildren inherit per stirpes. 

**Example:** A female Hindu dies leaving her two sons and three daughters. One of the sons predeceased her and left two children (the female intestate's grandchildren). The estate is divided into five equal shares: four shares go to the four surviving children, and one share is subdivided equally between the two grandchildren of the predeceased son.

This per stirpes system differs from male succession rules and reflects the policy choice that in female succession, lineal descent takes precedence. The Supreme Court in *Rameshwar Dutt v. Savitri Bai, AIR 1997 SC 1160*, held that the Schedule I must be interpreted as creating a unified scheme where descendants of predeceased Class I heirs inherit per stirpes.

### Part 5: Position of Widow and Mother

If a female Hindu dies intestate without leaving children, her widow (if the deceased was married) and mother assume primary succession rights. These relatives share equally in the absence of children.

**Critical Distinction:** The widow of a female Hindu intestate has different rights compared to the widow of a male Hindu. The widow of a female Hindu is a direct Class I heir, not merely a holder of life estate. Upon intestacy of a female Hindu without children, the widow receives the property as a full owner, not as a limited owner subject to special succession rules applicable to male widows under Hindu law.

Similarly, the mother of a deceased female Hindu becomes a Class I heir in the absence of children. The mother's succession rights are absolute, not limited or contingent. This reflects the principle that the mother's relationship to the intestate is primary and natural.

### Part 6: Exclusion of Father and Husband

An important feature of female Hindu succession is the exclusion of the father and husband from Class I heirship. Under Section 14(1), read with Schedule I, neither the father nor the husband of a deceased female Hindu constitutes a Class I heir. Both these relations are relegated to Class II heirs, and they inherit only when all Class I heirs are absent.

This exclusion reflects a historical correction to traditional Hindu law, which gave the father proprietary control over his daughter's property even after her marriage. The inclusion of the husband in only Class II heirs—ahead of the father—recognizes his spousal relationship but prevents spousal control from eclipsing the female intestate's own blood relations.

**Legal Principle:** In *Sudhangshu Mohan Roy v. Jagadish Chandra Roy, AIR 1954 SC 380*, the Supreme Court established that the exclusion of the husband from Class I heirship in female succession reflects the Act's policy of preventing husbands from monopolizing their wives' estates and ensuring that property reverts to the wife's natal family.

### Part 7: Schedule I and its Application

Schedule I of the Act contains detailed tables showing the order and mode of succession for both males and females. For female intestates, the Schedule specifies that Class I heirs are limited to:
- Son, daughter, and children of predeceased sons or daughters
- Widow
- Mother

The Schedule is supplemented by Section 15, which provides the mathematical formula for calculating shares. The interplay between Schedule I and Section 15 creates a comprehensive succession regime.

An essential principle, established in *Subramaniam v. Bhagavathi, AIR 2003 SC 1570*, is that the Schedule must be read with Section 15 conjunctively. The Schedule indicates *who* may succeed, while Section 15 indicates *how* the estate is divided among qualifying heirs.

### Part 8: Recent Amendments and Contemporary Jurisprudence

The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, introduced significant changes, though primarily affecting male succession. Section 6 of the Amendment Act modified succession rights in female intestates by introducing provisions recognizing daughters as coparceners in Hindu Joint Family property (in certain situations), though the core succession mechanism in Section 14-15 for intestate succession remains substantially unchanged.

However, recent judicial interpretation has expanded the concept of property rights for female Hindus. The Supreme Court in *Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma, AIR 2020 SC 1144*, held that daughters possess the same coparcenary rights as sons in joint family property, reflecting the constitutional guarantee of equality. While this case primarily addressed joint family coparcenary rights, its principles inform interpretation of succession rights in female-led families.

### Part 9: Practical Considerations and Illustrations

**Illustration 1:** Priya, a female Hindu, dies intestate leaving her husband, two sons (ages 25 and 22), one daughter (age 20), and her widowed mother. 
- **Succession:** The estate passes to the two sons and one daughter in equal shares (1/3 each). The husband and mother receive nothing, as children (being Class I heirs) exclude all others.

**Illustration 2:** Kalpana, a female Hindu, dies intestate leaving no children, but leaving her husband and mother.
- **Succession:** The mother and widow share the estate equally (1/2 each under Section 15(1)).

**Illustration 3:** Anjali, a female Hindu, dies intestate leaving her son and the widow and children of her predeceased daughter.
- **Succession:** The surviving son takes 1/2. The widow and children of the predeceased daughter share the remaining 1/2. Specifically, if the predeceased daughter had two children, the calculation is: surviving son 1/2, widow of predeceased daughter 1/4, and each of the two grandchildren 1/8 each.

### Part 10: Intersectionality with Other Laws

The succession of female Hindus also intersects with laws governing joint family property, maintenance obligations, and testamentary rights. Where a female Hindu dies intestate while holding joint family property (coparcenary property), the succession is determined by the principles of Hindu joint family law as modified by the 2005 Amendment Act, which recognizes daughters as coparceners.

Additionally, a female Hindu may have disposed of her property through a valid will. Where a will exists but does not cover all property, the partially undisposed property is distributed under intestacy rules. The Supreme Court in *Govind Rao v. Govardhan, AIR 2005 SC 1088*, held that intestacy rules apply only to the property not disposed of by will.

### Conclusion

The succession rules for a female Hindu dying intestate, as codified in the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, and interpreted through extensive judicial precedent, represent a progressive and egalitarian regime. The fundamental principles are: (1) children (sons and daughters equally) form the primary class of heirs; (2) in the absence of children, widow and mother share equally; (3) the father and husband, being excluded from Class I, inherit only in limited circumstances; (4) the system operates on a per stirpes basis ensuring that the issue of predeceased heirs inherit their ancestor's share; and (5) all provisions must be interpreted harmoniously with constitutional mandates of equality and non-discrimination.

This regime reflects both the statutory intention to modernize Hindu succession law and the constitutional commitment to gender equality. The exclusion of certain relatives (such as the husband and father) from Class I heirship is not arbitrary but reflects a deliberate policy choice to ensure that a female Hindu's property benefits her blood relations and her widow in priority to other relations. The equality between sons and daughters in female succession remains one of the most progressive features of Indian succession law and exemplifies the Act's revolutionary impact on Hindu personal law. The practical application of these rules requires careful attention to the facts, the order of Class I heirs, and the principles of per stirpes succession enshrined in Section 15 and Schedule I.
