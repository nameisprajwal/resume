## Q2: The Immovable Property of a Hindu Minor is Sold by the Father Without Court Permission. Is the Sale Valid?

**Year:** March 2023, December 2019  
**Marks:** 6

### QUESTION ANALYSIS

This is a problem-based question requiring application of Section 24 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, to specific facts.

### ANSWER

**Short Answer: NO, the sale is NOT VALID.**

### DETAILED ANALYSIS

#### I. LEGAL PROVISIONS

**Section 24 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956**

Section 24 provides that:

> "A guardian shall not sell, mortgage, pledge or exchange any immovable property of the ward without the previous written permission of the court."

This provision applies to:
- **All guardians**: Natural and court-appointed
- **All minors**: Legitimate and illegitimate
- **All immovable property**: Land, buildings, permanent structures

#### II. EXCEPTIONS

Section 24 provides limited exceptions where court permission is not required for certain transactions:

1. **Lease for not exceeding three years**: A guardian may lease immovable property without court permission if:
   - The lease term does not exceed three years
   - The lease is intended for agricultural or horticultural purposes or for residential occupancy
   - The anticipated rent is reasonable

2. **Sale of perishable property**: Transactions involving perishable goods do not require Section 24 compliance (however, immovable property is not perishable)

3. **Sale of property primarily for recovery of debt**: If immovable property is sold to recover debts contracted for the minor's benefit, the court's permission is required, but the court exercises greater discretion

#### III. APPLICATION TO THE HYPOTHETICAL

**Facts**: A father (natural guardian) sells a minor's immovable property for the benefit of the minor WITHOUT court permission.

**Even though the father's motivation—benefit to the minor—is laudable:**

**The sale is VOID/INVALID because:**

1. **Non-compliance with Section 24**: The father failed to obtain prior written court permission. This is a mandatory procedural requirement, not discretionary. Without compliance, the sale lacks legal validity.

2. **Lack of Court Authorization**: The court's role is protective. The court:
   - Examines whether the alienation is genuinely necessary for the minor's welfare
   - Verifies the transaction terms are commercially reasonable
   - Ensures proceeds will be properly accounted and applied
   - Protects the minor's long-term interests

Without these protections, the transaction cannot proceed.

3. **Transferee's Vulnerability**: Any purchaser acquiring the property faces a defective title. The minor (upon reaching majority) or a guardian appointed subsequently can challenge the transfer as unauthorized.

#### IV. CONSEQUENCES OF UNAUTHORIZED SALE

**1. Transfer is Void**: The purchaser acquires no valid title. The property remains the minor's.

**2. Right to Recover**: The minor (upon reaching majority) or a subsequent guardian can:
- Sue to recover the property
- Seek possession and damages
- Challenge the father's authority
- Demand restitution of proceeds

**3. Father's Liability**: The father, as natural guardian, may be held:
- Accountable for breach of fiduciary duty
- Liable to restore proceeds or their value
- Subject to removal from guardianship if the unauthorized sale demonstrates unfitness

**4. Purchaser's Recourse**: The innocent purchaser's only remedy is against the father (for breach of warranty or fraud), not against the minor.

#### V. LIMITED FLEXIBILITY: EMERGENCY DOCTRINE

Courts have recognized narrow exceptions where a guardian's unauthorized property transaction might be upheld:

1. **Genuine Emergency**: Life-threatening medical emergency requiring immediate fund procurement, where delay for court permission would be life-threatening

2. **Doctrine of Necessity**: Where unauthorized sale is absolutely necessary to prevent greater harm to the minor

**However**, these exceptions are strictly construed and:
- Require clear demonstration of genuine emergency
- Require the transaction to be reasonable and not exploitative
- Require the proceeds to be genuinely applied to the minor's benefit
- Do not apply to routine or planned alienations

In the hypothetical, the father could have sought court permission in advance. Lack of emergency distinguishes this case from genuine emergency situations.

#### VI. ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION

**Hypothetical**: Rajesh's minor son Arjun owns ancestral residential property. Rajesh seeks to sell the property to:
- Pay for Arjun's advanced medical treatment (genuine welfare necessity)
- OR to purchase better property closer to Arjun's school (investment for welfare)
- OR simply to meet Rajesh's own financial needs

**Analysis**:
- **Medical Treatment**: Court would likely grant permission. The necessity standard is met—the property alienation serves the minor's survival and health.
- **Property Improvement**: Court would examine the proposed replacement property's suitability and whether the transaction is on reasonable terms. Permission might be granted if the new property better serves the minor's interests.
- **Rajesh's Financial Needs**: Court would DENY permission. The father's personal financial difficulties do not constitute grounds for alienating the minor's immovable property.

**In all cases, court permission is REQUIRED** before proceeding.

#### VII. REMEDIAL STEPS

If the unauthorized sale has already occurred:

1. **Immediate Action**: Notify the purchaser of the legal defect
2. **Court Application**: File petition seeking:
   - Annulment of the unauthorized sale
   - Recovery of the property or its value
   - Damages from the father
3. **Protection Measures**: Seek court order placing restrictive conditions on the father's future guardianship exercise

#### VIII. CONCLUSION

**The sale is NOT VALID.** Section 24's requirement of prior court permission is mandatory and cannot be circumvented even with laudable intentions. The father's motivation—benefit to the minor—does not excuse procedural non-compliance. The requirement exists precisely to ensure that property alienations are genuinely necessary, fairly transacted, and properly applied. Without court permission, the transfer is void, and the minor (or subsequent guardian) has full authority to recover the property and pursue remedies against the father.

The principle underlying Section 24 is that protective mechanisms exist not as inconvenient formalities but as essential safeguards ensuring that minors' immovable property—foundational to long-term security—is not casually alienated without judicial scrutiny and approval.

## Q3: Dependents

**Year:** June 2019, September 2023, April/May 2022  
**Marks:** 6

### I. DEFINITION

A dependent, in the context of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, is a person entitled to claim maintenance from another person due to relationship, incapacity, or circumstances creating a legal obligation on the other person to provide sustenance.

Section 20 defines maintenance to include "food, clothing, shelter, education and medical attendance and treatment."

### II. CATEGORIES OF DEPENDENTS UNDER HINDU LAW

#### A. WIFE

A wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband. Sections 18-20 enumerate circumstances:

1. **Deserted Wife**: A wife abandoned by her husband without reasonable cause
2. **Wife of Diseased Husband**: A widow is entitled to maintenance from her husband's estate (Hindu Succession Act)
3. **Wife Living Apart**: A wife living separate but not divorced may claim maintenance
4. **Divorcee with Limited Means**: A Muslim divorcee under Muslim law; under Hindu law, post-amendment, a divorced woman may claim maintenance

**Conditions**:
- The wife must not be living in adultery
- The wife must not have transferred property (forfeiting rights in certain contexts)
- The wife must not have renounced the right to maintenance

#### B. CHILDREN

1. **Legitimate Children**: Children born within marriage are entitled to maintenance during minority (until age 18 or completion of education)

2. **Illegitimate Children**: Children born out of wedlock are entitled to maintenance from the biological father

3. **Adult Children**: Unmarried daughters are entitled to maintenance during their minority and even after if they remain unmarried and lack means

4. **Incapacitated Adult Children**: Children incapable of self-support due to physical/mental disability are entitled to maintenance

#### C. PARENTS

Aged parents are entitled to maintenance from adult children if the parent:
- Has reached old age (typically 60+)
- Lacks means of self-support
- Is unable to earn livelihood

#### D. STEPCHILDREN

Stepchildren may be entitled to maintenance if:
- The stepparent undertook responsibility for maintenance
- The biological parent cannot provide
- The stepparent agreed to provide maintenance

#### E. GRANDCHILDREN

Grandchildren may be entitled to maintenance from grandparents if:
- The child's parents are deceased or incapable
- The grandparent is capable of providing
- No other person is available to provide maintenance

#### F. WIDOWS

A widow is entitled to maintenance from:
- Her husband's estate
- Her husband's heirs (if estate is insufficient)
- Limited circumstances: father and father-in-law

## Q4: Arundati Refuses to Live with Her Husband's Aged Parents - Case Analysis

**Year:** June 2019  
**Marks:** 6

### FACTS

Arundati refuses to live with her husband as long as he remained with his aged parents. She approaches the court seeking:
- Separate residence for herself and her husband
- Maintenance

### ISSUES

1. Can a wife compel her husband to maintain separate residence away from his aged parents?
2. Is she entitled to maintenance despite refusing to cohabitate?

### RELEVANT LAW

- Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (particularly restitution of conjugal rights provisions)
- Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (particularly maintenance provisions)
- General principles of family law and conjugal obligations

### LEGAL ANALYSIS

#### A. DUTY OF COHABITATION

Hindu law imposes upon both husband and wife a mutual duty of cohabitation. A wife's refusal to cohabitate without reasonable justification may:
- Constitute abandonment or breach of marital duty
- Deprive the wife of maintenance
- Justify the husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights

#### B. "REASONABLE CAUSE" FOR REFUSAL

Courts recognize limited "reasonable causes" for refusing cohabitation:
- Risk to personal safety (domestic violence, threat of harm)
- Conditions demonstrably dangerous to health
- Severe incompatibility rendering cohabitation impossible
- Cruelty or extreme neglect by the husband or his family members

#### C. LIVING WITH AGED PARENTS: ANALYSIS

**Ordinarily, a wife cannot refuse to cohabitate merely because her husband's aged parents reside with them.** Reasons:

1. **Cultural and Legal Recognition**: Hindu law and Indian society traditionally recognize the joint family structure and the adult son's duty to support aged parents

2. **No Constitutional Right to Separate**: While the wife has rights, these do not include a right to compel separation from the husband's parents against the husband's wishes

3. **Husband's Conflicting Obligation**: An adult son has a legal obligation to maintain aged parents. Forcing separation violates this obligation

#### D. EXCEPTION: CRUELTY BY IN-LAWS

**If** the in-laws engage in cruelty, abuse, or create genuinely unsafe conditions, the wife might establish reasonable grounds for refusing cohabitation. In such cases:
- The wife can refuse cohabitation with the in-laws
- BUT the husband remains obligated to provide maintenance to the wife
- The husband may choose to separate from his parents to continue marital cohabitation, or accept loss of marital relationship

### LEGAL CONCLUSION

**Arundati will NOT succeed in her petition.**

**Reasons**:

1. **No Reasonable Justification**: Merely living with aged parents, without evidence of abuse or cruelty, does not constitute reasonable ground for refusing cohabitation

2. **Maintenance Contingent on Cohabitation**: If Arundati refuses cohabitation without just cause, she forfeits her right to maintenance during the period of unjustified refusal

3. **Husband's Conflicting Obligation**: The law recognizes the husband's duty to support aged parents and cannot require him to abandon this duty

### REMEDY FOR ARUNDATI

If the in-laws are genuinely abusive:
- Arundati should document the cruelty and abuse
- File a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act citing cruelty as grounds for separation or divorce
- Request separate maintenance during and after divorce proceedings
- In appropriate cases, seek relief under domestic violence statutes

### CONCLUSION

The law does not permit a wife to unilaterally dictate her husband's living arrangements or compel separation from aged parents merely on the wife's preference. However, if genuine cruelty or abuse by in-laws exists, the wife has remedies through statutory provisions addressing cruelty and domestic violence.

## Q5: Write a Note on Maintenance of Wife

**Year:** December 2019  
**Marks:** 6

### I. STATUTORY BASIS

The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, Sections 18-20, govern spousal maintenance.

Section 18 provides that a wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband in certain circumstances, while Section 19 imposes correlative duties on husbands.

### II. CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANTING MAINTENANCE

#### A. WIFE LIVING APART FROM HUSBAND

A wife is entitled to maintenance if she is living apart from her husband due to:

1. **Husband's Desertion**: The husband has abandoned her without reasonable cause
2. **Cruelty**: The wife lives separately due to the husband's cruelty (physical, emotional, or mental abuse)
3. **Husband's Infidelity**: In limited circumstances, infidelity constitutes grounds for separate maintenance
4. **Husband's Conversion to Another Religion**: If the husband converts, abandoning Hindu faith
5. **Husband's Imprisonment**: Imprisonment for crime deprives the wife of support

#### B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

- The wife must not be living in **adultery** (infidelity during separation)
- The wife must not have **renounced** her right to maintenance
- The wife must be otherwise **deserving** (not having engaged in serious misconduct)

### III. QUANTUM OF WIFE'S MAINTENANCE

Courts determine maintenance based on:

1. **Status and Station**: The parties' social and economic standing
2. **Husband's Capacity**: The husband's income and assets
3. **Wife's Needs**: Reasonable requirements for sustenance and living
4. **Wife's Income**: Any independent income the wife possesses
5. **Duration of Marriage**: Longer marriages may warrant higher maintenance
6. **Conduct**: Serious misconduct may reduce maintenance

### IV. RIGHTS OF WIFE DURING MARRIAGE

#### A. HUSBAND'S OBLIGATION OF SUPPORT

During marriage, a husband is obligated to provide for the wife's:
- Basic sustenance (food, clothing, shelter)
- Medical expenses
- Educational expenses (where applicable)
- Reasonable comfort consistent with the parties' status

#### B. WIFE'S DUTY OF COHABITATION

Correlatively, the wife has a duty to cohabitate with the husband. Unjustified refusal may deprive the wife of maintenance.

#### C. MAINTENANCE POST-DIVORCE

Upon divorce:
- A divorced wife is entitled to reasonable maintenance if she lacks means to support herself
- Lump-sum settlement or periodic maintenance may be ordered
- Remarriage typically terminates a divorced wife's right to maintenance

### V. CONTEMPORARY JURISPRUDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Modern courts recognize:

1. **Gender-Neutral Principles**: In principle, husbands are also entitled to maintenance from wives in limited circumstances (though less commonly applied)

2. **Substantive Justice**: Courts focus on ensuring that economically weaker spouse receives adequate support, regardless of gender

3. **Restitution Theory**: Some courts view maintenance as restitution for the spouse's contribution to marriage and family life

### VI. CONCLUSION

Wife's maintenance under Hindu law reflects the principle that marriage creates economic interdependence, and the economically stronger spouse (typically the husband) has an obligation to sustain the weaker spouse (typically the wife). This obligation persists during marriage and continues post-separation/divorce if the wife lacks independent means. Maintenance protects women's economic security and recognizes their contribution to family life and marriage.

## Q6: A and B Jointly Adopt 'C' as a Son. Is this Adoption Valid?

**Year:** March/April 2021  
**Marks:** 6

### ANSWER: GENERALLY NO, but with contemporary developments.

### LEGAL ANALYSIS

#### A. STATUTORY LANGUAGE

The Act refers to adoption by "a person" (singular). Sections 8-12 contemplate adoption by an individual, not joint adoption by multiple persons.

#### B. TRADITIONAL INTERPRETATION

Pre-codification Hindu law discouraged joint adoption because:
1. Adoption created a parent-child relationship requiring unified parental authority
2. Joint adoption created ambiguity regarding authority
3. Disputes between joint adopters could prejudice the child's welfare

#### C. MODERN JUDICIAL APPROACH

Courts have increasingly recognized **joint adoption by married couples** as permissible on grounds that:

1. **Welfare Principle**: Joint adoption by a married couple often better serves the child's welfare through dual parental support

2. **Constitutional Imperatives**: Joint adoption respects gender equality and recognizes both spouses as capable parents

3. **Practical Reality**: Modern marriage involves joint decision-making and mutual parental responsibility

#### D. CURRENT LEGAL POSITION

**Married Couples**: Can adopt jointly in most Indian jurisdictions, with courts treating both spouses as co-adopters, each acquiring full parental rights and responsibilities.

**Unmarried Couples**: Courts have NOT recognized joint adoption by unmarried partners. The adoption typically requires being undertaken by one individual, with the other potentially acquiring guardianship rights subsequently.

**Multiple Unrelated Persons**: Cannot jointly adopt, as no legal mechanism or purpose is served.

### CONCLUSION

**Joint adoption by married couple A and B is VALID**, subject to compliance with all other requirements (capacity, welfare principle, procedural formalities). **Joint adoption by unmarried partners is generally NOT VALID** under current law, though this jurisprudence faces constitutional challenges regarding same-sex partnerships and non-traditional families.

## Q7: Doctrine of Relation Back

**Year:** March/April 2021, August/September 2024  
**Marks:** 6

### I. DEFINITION

The Doctrine of Relation Back operates in adoption law to provide that the legal effects of adoption are deemed to relate back to the date of the adoption deed, not the date of court's sanction of adoption.

### II. STATUTORY BASIS

While not explicitly stated in the Act, the doctrine emerges from Section 16, which provides that "the adoption is complete as soon as the child is given," and Section 13's provision regarding the effect of adoption.

### III. LEGAL EFFECTS OF RELATION BACK DOCTRINE

#### A. SUCCESSION RIGHTS

Upon adoption, the adopted child acquires succession rights in the adoptive father's property **as if the child had been born at the time of the adoption deed**, not at the time of court sanction. This ensures the adopted child inherits as an adopted son/daughter with full succession rights, including participation in ancestral property.

#### B. PROPERTY RIGHTS

The adopted child acquires ownership rights in the adoptive family's property from the date of adoption deed.

#### C. LEGITIMACY STATUS

The adopted child's status as a "legitimate" child (in terms of the Hindu Succession Act) dates back to the adoption deed.

#### D. MAINTENANCE AND GUARDIANSHIP

The duty to maintain and provide guardianship arises from the adoption deed date, though practical exercise of guardianship commences upon custody transfer.

### IV. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

**Scenario**: 
- Priya executes adoption deed on 15th January 2024
- Court sanctions adoption on 30th June 2024
- The adopted child's father dies on 20th February 2024

**Legal Position**:
- Despite the father's death occurring before court sanction, the adopted child acquires succession rights as if the adoption was effective from 15th January 2024
- The child becomes entitled to share in the father's succession

### V. EXCEPTION: DURING GUARDIANSHIP DISPUTE

Where two parties claim guardianship and adoption by one is pending, the doctrine may not apply retrospectively if:
- The court finds the adoption was not genuinely undertaken for child's welfare
- The adoption was procured through fraud or misrepresentation

## Q8: 'A' a Widow Sues Her Father and Father-in-Law for Maintenance

**Year:** April/May 2022  
**Marks:** 6

### QUESTION ANALYSIS

Can a widow sue both her father and father-in-law separately for maintenance?

### ANSWER: LIMITED YES

### LEGAL ANALYSIS

#### A. WIDOW'S MAINTENANCE RIGHTS

A widow may claim maintenance from:

1. **Husband's Estate**: Primary source—the widow's entitlement is from her deceased husband's property/estate (Hindu Succession Act)

2. **Husband's Heirs**: If the estate is insufficient, heirs have maintenance obligations

3. **Limited Right from Family Members**: Under limited circumstances, the widow may claim from other family members

#### B. FATHER'S OBLIGATION

A father's obligation to maintain an adult widow daughter:
- Is NOT a primary obligation
- Arises only if the widow has no other means of support and no other family members can provide
- Is limited to the father's capacity

#### C. FATHER-IN-LAW'S OBLIGATION

A father-in-law's obligation arises:
- If the husband is deceased and the estate is insufficient
- If there are no other heirs capable of providing
- As a secondary obligation

#### D. LEGAL POSITION ON DUAL SUITS

**The widow can sue both, BUT:**

1. The primary obligation remains on the husband's heirs/estate

2. The father and father-in-law are secondary obligants—required to contribute only if primary sources are insufficient

3. The widow cannot recover duplicate amounts from multiple sources

4. Courts will direct that maintenance be paid by those best able to pay in hierarchy of obligation

### CONCLUSION

**Yes, the widow can sue both separately, BUT with important qualifications:**
- She must first establish insufficient support from the primary source (husband's estate/heirs)
- She can recover from secondary sources (father, father-in-law) only to the extent of actual need
- The obligation is to provide reasonable maintenance, not enrichment

## Q10: 'A' Adopts 'B' Who is Already Adopted by 'C'. Is this Adoption Valid? Advise them.

**Year:** September 2023, June/July 2025  
**Marks:** 6

### ANSWER: NO, the adoption is NOT VALID.

### LEGAL REASONING

#### A. DOCTRINE OF SEVERANCE

Adoption operates to sever all prior familial relationships. Once 'B' is adopted by 'C', 'B' ceases to have any relationship with biological parents and becomes exclusively 'C's child for all legal purposes.

#### B. LEGAL EFFECT

Upon 'C's adoption of 'B':
- 'B' is no longer available for adoption by anyone else
- 'B's status is that of an adopted child of 'C'
- 'B' is an alien person to all others

#### C. ATTEMPTED RE-ADOPTION

When 'A' attempts to adopt 'B' (already adopted by 'C'):
- There is no "child" to adopt in the sense contemplated by the Act
- 'B' is already in the legal position of an adopted child
- The second adoption lacks the requisite condition of transferring a child from natural or primary guardianship to new guardianship

#### D. ANALOGY

Re-adoption would be analogous to:
- Selling property already sold to another (defective title)
- Marrying a person already married (bigamy, void)
- Adopting a person already adopted (legally impossible)

### CONSEQUENCES

**If 'A' and 'B' purport to complete adoption despite 'B' being previously adopted:**
- The second adoption is void
- No legal relationship is created between 'A' and 'B'
- Any registration of the second adoption is invalid
- The adoption deed is legally ineffective

### REMEDIES

**If 'A' genuinely seeks to have 'B' as a child:**
- **Guardianship**: 'A' can petition for guardianship appointment over 'B' if 'C' consents or if grounds for removing 'C' exist
- **Legal Facilitation**: If 'C' is unfit or deceased, the court can appoint 'A' as guardian
- **Informal Relationship**: 'A' can establish an in loco parentis relationship without formal adoption

### ADVICE

**To 'A' and 'B':**
1. The adoption of 'B' by 'C' is a completed, irrevocable status change
2. Attempting re-adoption is legally futile and will be declared void
3. If 'C's guardianship is unsatisfactory, pursue remedies through:
   - Guardianship modification proceedings
   - Guardian removal petitions based on unfitness
   - Court authorization for 'A' to assume guardianship
4. If 'C' consents to 'B's transfer to 'A', seek court authorization for guardianship change rather than pursuing invalid re-adoption

## Q13: Ajay and Vijay Jointly Want to Adopt a Child - Advice

**Year:** January/February 2025  
**Marks:** 6

### FACTUAL SITUATION

Two individuals (presumably male friends or partners) Ajay and Vijay seek joint adoption.

### LEGAL ANALYSIS

#### A. CAPACITY TO ADOPT

Both Ajay and Vijay individually must satisfy:
- Age requirement (21+)
- Hindu status
- Sound mind
- No existing legitimate son/daughter (traditionally, though this is being questioned)

#### B. JOINT ADOPTION SCENARIO

#### IF MARRIED COUPLE:
**Answer: Joint adoption is VALID**
- Courts recognize joint adoption by married couples
- Both spouses acquire co-equal parental rights
- Child's welfare is served through dual parental support
- Recommended approach

#### IF UNMARRIED PARTNERS OR FRIENDS:
**Answer: Joint adoption is NOT VALID**
- Current law does not recognize joint adoption except by married couples
- One individual must adopt, with the other potentially acquiring guardianship through subsequent court authorization
- Unmarried couples (regardless of gender) cannot jointly adopt

### PRACTICAL ADVICE

#### OPTION 1: MARRY AND THEN ADOPT
If Ajay and Vijay are life partners:
- Legally marry (if applicable jurisdiction recognizes such marriage)
- Then proceed with joint adoption as a married couple

#### OPTION 2: ONE-PERSON ADOPTION
- One of them (Ajay) adopts the child as an individual
- The other (Vijay) can:
  - Be named as guardian in court proceedings
  - Assume co-parental responsibilities through informal arrangements
  - Later petition for court guardianship if necessary

#### OPTION 3: GUARDIANSHIP ROUTE
- Rather than adoption, pursue court-appointed guardianship for both
- Court can appoint both as co-guardians based on welfare principle
- This provides legal recognition without requiring joint adoption (currently unavailable)

### CONCLUSION

**Advice**: If Ajay and Vijay are a married couple, joint adoption is valid and recommended. If they are unmarried partners or friends, joint adoption is not currently permissible under law. They should consider alternative legal mechanisms (individual adoption + co-guardianship, or guardianship route) to achieve their protective objectives for the child while ensuring legal recognition of both individuals' roles.
