You are an expert document-analysis system.

You will read 10 uploaded PDF files containing question papers.

Each PDF corresponds to a specific year, and inside each year there are five units (Unit-1 to Unit-5).

Each unit contains approximately 10 questions, but the number may vary.



Each question is printed in two languages:



English version



Kannada version





Your task is to extract all questions, organize them unit-wise, and generate two separate markdown files:





---



✅ OUTPUT FILE 1: English Questions (Markdown)



For each Unit (Unit-1 to Unit-5):



List all English questions in order.



For each question, attach tag fields:



Marks: (Extract exactly as given in PDF — e.g., 2 Marks / 5 Marks / 10 Marks)



Year: (Year of the question paper)



Month: (Month of the exam — e.g., June 2020 / Nov 2021)







Format:



# Unit-1

## Q1. <English question text>

- **Marks:** X

- **Year:** YYYY

- **Month:** MMMM



## Q2. <English question text>

- Marks…

- Year…

- Month…



Repeat for Unit-2 to Unit-5.

✅ OUTPUT FILE 2: Kannada Questions (Markdown)



Follow the same structure as above, but include only the Kannada version of each question.



Use the following format:



# Unit-1

## Q1. <Kannada question text>

- **Marks:** X

- **Year:** YYYY

- **Month:** MMMM

📌 Extraction Rules



1. Each question must have both tags:



Marks



Year & Month







2. If English and Kannada appear together, extract each version separately but keep their tags identical.





3. If a question appears more than once across PDFs, include it each time with its respective year/month.





4. If any question’s marks or date is unclear, infer using the nearest header but do NOT guess.



If not found, use:



Marks: Unknown



Year: Unknown



Month: Unknown









5. Maintain proper markdown formatting — no broken structures.
